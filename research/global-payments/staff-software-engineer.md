**Negotiation DNA**

The Staff Software Engineer at Global Payments is, in practice, the technical decision-maker for the $24B Worldpay re-integration at the system-design level. While VPs set strategy and senior engineers execute, the Staff engineer defines the architecture that will determine whether two of the world's largest payment platforms can be unified into a single, coherent system. This is Payment Orchestration at its most consequential — designing the routing logic, data models, and integration patterns that 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries will depend on for the next decade.

At this level, you are a Synergy Architect in the literal sense. Your technical decisions directly determine how many of the projected Worldpay synergies GPN actually captures. A well-designed unified commerce platform schema could save hundreds of millions in downstream integration costs. A poorly designed one could delay synergy realization by years. GPN's leadership knows this, and the scarcity of staff-level engineers with payment platform integration experience gives you extraordinary negotiation leverage.

Global Payments competes for Staff-level talent against Google, Meta, Stripe, and top-tier hedge funds. The total comp gap between GPN and FAANG at this level can be significant, but the equity upside of joining during the Worldpay integration window — when GPN's stock is poised to re-rate as synergies materialize — creates a compelling counter-narrative. Use that narrative, but demand the numbers to back it up.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Architecture-Level Synergy Impact:** "At the Staff level, my architectural decisions on the $24B Worldpay re-integration will directly determine whether GPN captures its projected synergies. I'm not writing features — I'm designing the unified data model that 4M+ merchant locations depend on. That level of impact warrants Staff-level FAANG compensation, and I'd like to see a base at $245,000 (Atlanta) or $275,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Payment Orchestration Architecture Scarcity:** "There are perhaps 200 engineers in the world who have designed Payment Orchestration systems at the scale GPN requires — routing transactions across 100+ countries with real-time settlement. I'm one of them. The RSU package should reflect that scarcity: I'm looking for $320,000-$400,000 over four years, which is still below what Stripe and Adyen would offer for equivalent scope."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Technical Leadership:** "The Synergy Architect role at the Staff level means I'll be setting technical standards that every engineer on the unified commerce platform follows. That's a force-multiplier effect — my design patterns will be replicated across hundreds of services. I'd like to discuss a supplemental equity grant specifically tied to integration architecture milestones."

**Lever 4 — Integration Window Opportunity Cost:** "Joining GPN during the Worldpay integration means I'm foregoing offers with more liquid equity at established tech companies. The integration window is a 3-4 year commitment with meaningful execution risk. I need the offer to compensate for that opportunity cost — a $50,000-$75,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed Year 2 RSU refresh of at least $100,000."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $245,000 base (Atlanta) / $275,000 (NYC) with $320,000-$400,000 RSUs over 4 years. Anchor on FAANG Staff-level benchmarks and the architecture-level impact on Worldpay synergy capture. Push for a $50,000-$75,000 sign-on bonus by framing it as "integration opportunity cost compensation." Your accept-at floor should be $205,000 base (Atlanta) / $230,000 (NYC) with at least $200,000 RSU. If they resist on base, negotiate a guaranteed Year 2 RSU refresh of $80,000-$100,000 and a title guarantee of "Staff" (not "Senior" with Staff responsibilities). Total first-year comp target: $480,000+ (Atlanta) / $570,000+ (NYC). The Synergy Architect framing is your strongest card — architecture decisions at this level are irreversible and GPN cannot afford to get them wrong.
