**Negotiation DNA**

The Senior Software Engineer at Global Payments occupies the most critical execution layer during the $24B Worldpay re-integration. You are the person who translates the Synergy Architect vision into production-grade systems — designing the APIs that unify merchant data across 100+ countries, building the Payment Orchestration services that route billions of dollars in transactions daily, and mentoring junior engineers through the most complex integration in payment technology history. At $9B+ in annual revenue and 4M+ merchant locations, the systems you build have zero margin for error.

Global Payments competes for senior talent against Stripe, Adyen, Block, and the major banks. The Worldpay re-integration creates a unique selling point: nowhere else can a senior engineer work on a unified commerce platform of this scale, touching every payment modality — card-present, card-not-present, real-time payments, cross-border settlement — within a single company. But that selling point cuts both ways. The complexity demands premium compensation, and GPN's recruiters know that losing a senior engineer mid-integration can cost the company months of re-integration timeline. Use that knowledge strategically.

The Synergy Architect framing is especially powerful at this level because senior engineers are expected to own integration workstreams end-to-end. You are not just contributing to synergies — you are architecting them. Your negotiation should reflect that ownership.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Integration Ownership Premium:** "At the senior level, I'll be owning entire workstreams within the $24B Worldpay re-integration — not just writing code, but designing the systems that unify two payment platforms. That ownership scope is closer to a Staff-level role at most companies, and I'd like the compensation to reflect the integration-era responsibilities I'm stepping into."

**Lever 2 — Cross-Border Payment Orchestration Expertise:** "My experience building payment systems that operate across multiple regulatory jurisdictions maps precisely to GPN's challenge of unifying merchant data across 100+ countries. Payment Orchestration engineers with cross-border experience are being recruited aggressively by Stripe, Adyen, and the neobanks — I'd like to see a base of $190,000 (Atlanta) to remain competitive with those offers."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Multiplier Effect:** "As a Synergy Architect at the senior level, my technical decisions will directly influence whether GPN captures the projected synergies from Worldpay. One well-designed API can save millions in integration costs across 4M+ merchant locations. I'd like to discuss an RSU package of $160,000-$200,000 over four years to align my incentives with those synergy outcomes."

**Lever 4 — Mid-Integration Retention Risk:** "The payment technology market is extremely competitive right now, and senior engineers with integration experience are the highest-attrition risk during a deal of this magnitude. I'd like a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus and a provision for an RSU refresh at the 12-month mark, contingent on integration milestones, to lock in mutual commitment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $190,000 base (Atlanta) / $215,000 (NYC) with $160,000-$200,000 RSUs over 4 years. Cite the Worldpay re-integration ownership premium and competing offers from Stripe/Adyen. Push for a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus framed as "Synergy Architect commitment capital." Your accept-at floor should be $160,000 base (Atlanta) / $185,000 (NYC) with at least $100,000 RSU. If they push back on base, negotiate for accelerated vesting (30% year-one instead of 25%) and a guaranteed RSU refresh at the 12-month review. Total first-year comp target: $300,000+ (Atlanta) / $360,000+ (NYC).
