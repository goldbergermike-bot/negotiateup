**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Global Payments sit on what may be the most valuable transaction dataset in the world. The $24B Worldpay re-integration is merging two colossal merchant data ecosystems — GPN's domestic acquiring data and Worldpay's global processing data — creating a unified view of consumer spending behavior across 100+ countries and 4M+ merchant locations. For a data scientist, this is the equivalent of discovering a new continent: an uncharted landscape of cross-border transaction patterns, merchant cohort behaviors, and payment modality preferences that no one has analyzed in combination before.

The Synergy Architect role for a data scientist is about finding the hidden value in the merged dataset. Payment Orchestration decisions — how to route transactions, which acquirer to select, how to optimize authorization rates — are fundamentally data science problems. Every percentage point of authorization rate improvement across GPN's $9B+ revenue base translates to hundreds of millions in additional transaction volume flowing through the platform. GPN needs data scientists who can build the models that power these decisions, and the Worldpay integration creates a brief window where the data is newly combined and the competitive moat from analyzing it is at its deepest.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Merged Dataset Value Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration is creating the largest unified merchant transaction dataset in the payments industry. As a data scientist, I'll be the first person to analyze cross-platform patterns across 4M+ merchant locations in 100+ countries. That's a unique value-creation opportunity, and the compensation should reflect the revenue impact of the insights I'll generate — I'm targeting a base of $180,000 (Atlanta) or $205,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Payment Orchestration Intelligence:** "Payment Orchestration is fundamentally a data science problem — routing decisions, authorization optimization, fraud scoring — all of these require models trained on the unified dataset. My models will directly improve GPN's authorization rates, and each basis point of improvement is worth millions annually. The RSU package should reflect that P&L impact: $140,000-$180,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Analytics:** "The Synergy Architect vision requires data scientists who can quantify synergy realization in real time. I'll be building the dashboards and models that tell GPN's leadership whether the Worldpay integration is delivering its projected value. That's strategic analytics at the C-suite level, and I'd like a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$25,000 to reflect the strategic scope."

**Lever 4 — Fintech Data Science Talent War:** "Data scientists with payment domain expertise are being recruited by Stripe, JPMorgan, and top hedge funds — all of which offer higher base compensation. I'm drawn to the Worldpay integration data opportunity, but I need the total comp to be competitive. I'd like to see accelerated first-year RSU vesting and a guaranteed bonus floor of 15% of base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base (Atlanta) / $205,000 (NYC) with $140,000-$180,000 RSUs over 4 years. Anchor on the merged dataset value premium — the Worldpay re-integration creates a data asset that no competitor can replicate, and your models will directly monetize it. Push for a $20,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus and accelerated vesting. Your accept-at floor should be $150,000 base (Atlanta) / $170,000 (NYC) with at least $90,000 RSU. If they counter below, request a guaranteed Year 1 performance review with RSU refresh eligibility and scope commitment to cross-platform Payment Orchestration analytics. Frame yourself as the Synergy Architect who quantifies the Worldpay deal's ROI. Total first-year comp target: $280,000+ (Atlanta) / $340,000+ (NYC).
