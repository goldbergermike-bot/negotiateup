**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Global Payments carry a burden that few other roles in technology can match: protecting billions of dollars in daily transaction volume across a platform that is being fundamentally rebuilt. The $24B Worldpay re-integration means merging two separate security architectures — different encryption standards, different access control models, different audit frameworks — into a single, unified security posture that must satisfy PCI-DSS Level 1, GDPR, and dozens of country-specific data protection regulations across 100+ countries. A single security breach during the integration could cost GPN billions in fines, merchant churn, and reputational damage.

The Synergy Architect vision for a Security Engineer is about building the unified security platform that protects the merged Payment Orchestration layer. This means designing the tokenization and encryption infrastructure that works across both legacy systems, building the fraud detection layer that leverages the combined transaction data from 4M+ merchant locations, and ensuring that every API in the unified commerce platform meets the security standards that $9B+ in annual revenue demands. Security engineers with PCI-DSS expertise and large-scale integration experience are among the scarcest and most valuable hires in fintech, and the Worldpay integration makes this scarcity even more acute.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Integration Security Architecture Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration creates the largest security architecture unification challenge in the payments industry. I'll be merging two PCI-DSS Level 1 environments, consolidating encryption key management, and building unified access controls across 100+ countries. That security integration scope warrants a base of $190,000 (Atlanta) or $215,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Payment Orchestration Security Layer:** "The Payment Orchestration platform requires a security layer that protects transaction routing across multiple acquirers and payment networks. Every transaction touching the unified commerce platform — serving 4M+ merchant locations — flows through the security architecture I design. A breach would cost billions. The RSU package should reflect that risk-mitigation value: $140,000-$180,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Compliance Unification:** "As a Synergy Architect on the security side, I'll be consolidating compliance frameworks across the merged entity — reducing duplicated audit costs, streamlining PCI assessment processes, and building a unified security monitoring platform. These are direct synergy savings that appear on GPN's income statement, and my compensation should reflect that P&L contribution with a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$30,000."

**Lever 4 — Payment Security Talent Scarcity:** "Security engineers with PCI-DSS Level 1 experience and payment infrastructure expertise are the most sought-after hires in fintech. JPMorgan, Stripe, and Visa are all competing for this talent with significantly higher total comp. I'm drawn to the Worldpay integration security challenge, but I need the offer to close the gap — accelerated vesting and a guaranteed bonus floor of 18% of base would demonstrate GPN's commitment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $190,000 base (Atlanta) / $215,000 (NYC) with $140,000-$180,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the integration security architecture premium — unifying two PCI-DSS Level 1 environments during a $24B merger is principal-level security work. Push for a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and frame it as "integration security commitment compensation." Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base (Atlanta) / $180,000 (NYC) with at least $90,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for a Senior Security Engineer title, a guaranteed bonus floor of 18%, and a defined scope commitment to Payment Orchestration security architecture. The Synergy Architect framing positions your compliance unification work as a direct cost savings driver. Total first-year comp target: $300,000+ (Atlanta) / $360,000+ (NYC).
