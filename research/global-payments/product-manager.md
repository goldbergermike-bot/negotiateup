**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Global Payments during the Worldpay re-integration are defining the product strategy for the most ambitious unified commerce platform in payment technology. The $24B Worldpay deal brings together two massive product portfolios — GPN's merchant-acquiring suite and Worldpay's global payment processing capabilities — and the PM is the person who decides what the combined product looks like. Which features survive, which get deprecated, how 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries experience the transition — these are product decisions with billions of dollars of revenue at stake.

The Payment Orchestration vision requires PMs who can think at both the strategic and tactical level. Strategically, you are defining the roadmap for a $9B+ revenue platform that spans every payment modality and every major market. Tactically, you are making daily prioritization calls that determine integration velocity and merchant satisfaction. The Synergy Architect mindset for a PM means understanding that every product decision either accelerates or delays the realization of Worldpay synergies. GPN's product organization is being rebuilt around this integration, and PMs who can navigate the complexity of merging two product cultures will be exceptionally valuable — and should be compensated accordingly.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Product Integration Strategy Premium:** "As a Product Manager during the $24B Worldpay re-integration, I'm not just managing a product — I'm defining the unified product strategy for two massive payment platforms. Every roadmap decision I make impacts synergy capture across 4M+ merchant locations. That strategic scope justifies compensation at the top of the band, and I'm targeting a base of $185,000 (Atlanta) or $210,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Merchant Experience Orchestration:** "The Payment Orchestration layer isn't just a technical challenge — it's a product challenge. I need to ensure that merchants in 100+ countries experience a seamless transition to the unified commerce platform. My experience driving product consolidation during platform mergers is directly applicable, and the RSU package should reflect the rarity of PMs who have managed product unification at this global scale."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Product Vision:** "The Synergy Architect philosophy means the PM is the person who translates business synergy targets into product features. I'll be directly responsible for defining the merchant data unification experience — how 4M+ locations interact with the consolidated platform. I'd like an RSU grant of $160,000-$200,000 to align my long-term incentives with the multi-year product integration roadmap."

**Lever 4 — Competitive Product Talent Market:** "PMs with payment platform experience are being recruited aggressively by Stripe, Block, and Adyen, all of which offer significantly higher equity packages. I'm choosing GPN because of the Worldpay integration opportunity, but I need the total comp to be competitive. A $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and accelerated first-year vesting would close the gap."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185,000 base (Atlanta) / $210,000 (NYC) with $160,000-$200,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the product integration strategy premium — defining the unified product for a $24B merger is VP-level scope at a PM-level title. Push for a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and request a 6-month title review for Senior PM. Your accept-at floor should be $155,000 base (Atlanta) / $175,000 (NYC) with at least $100,000 RSU. If they counter below, request a guaranteed bonus floor of 18% and a commitment to Synergy Architect-level product ownership scope. Total first-year comp target: $310,000+ (Atlanta) / $370,000+ (NYC).
