**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Global Payments are building the plumbing that makes the $24B Worldpay re-integration possible. Before data scientists can model, before ML engineers can train, before analysts can report — the data engineer must unify two of the largest transaction data ecosystems in the world. GPN's domestic merchant data and Worldpay's global processing data live in different schemas, different warehouses, different formats. The Data Engineer designs and builds the pipelines, ETL processes, and unified data models that transform this chaos into a coherent data platform spanning 100+ countries and 4M+ merchant locations.

The Payment Orchestration platform cannot function without reliable, real-time data flows. Transaction routing decisions, fraud detection, authorization optimization, merchant analytics — all of these depend on data pipelines that the Data Engineer builds and maintains. The Synergy Architect role for a Data Engineer is perhaps the most literal of any function: you are architecturally unifying the data from two separate companies into a single source of truth. Every pipeline you build that successfully merges GPN and Worldpay data is a concrete synergy capture — eliminating redundant data infrastructure, enabling cross-platform analytics, and powering the $9B+ revenue engine with unified merchant intelligence.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Data Unification Complexity Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration requires merging two entirely separate transaction data ecosystems — different schemas, different warehouses, different data quality standards. As a Data Engineer, I'm building the unified data platform that every other function depends on. That foundational complexity warrants a base of $180,000 (Atlanta) or $205,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Payment Orchestration Data Infrastructure:** "Payment Orchestration routing decisions require real-time data pipelines with sub-second latency across 100+ countries. I'll be building the data infrastructure that powers transaction routing for 4M+ merchant locations. The reliability and performance requirements for this data layer are among the most demanding in the industry, and the RSU package should reflect it — $130,000-$170,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Data Platform:** "As a Synergy Architect on the data side, every pipeline I build that unifies GPN and Worldpay data eliminates duplicated infrastructure and enables new cross-platform analytics. These are measurable synergy captures — reduced storage costs, consolidated tooling, and unified merchant intelligence. I'd like a performance bonus structure that rewards data unification milestones, with a guaranteed floor of 15% of base."

**Lever 4 — Data Engineering Talent Scarcity in Payments:** "Data engineers who understand payment data models, PCI-compliant data handling, and real-time streaming at GPN's scale are exceptionally rare. Stripe, Coinbase, and major banks are all competing for this talent. I'd like a $20,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus to offset the opportunity cost of choosing GPN during the integration period, when workload intensity will be at its peak."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180,000 base (Atlanta) / $205,000 (NYC) with $130,000-$170,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the data unification complexity premium — you are building the data foundation that the entire $24B Worldpay re-integration depends on. Push for a $20,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed bonus floor of 15%. Your accept-at floor should be $150,000 base (Atlanta) / $170,000 (NYC) with at least $85,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for a Senior Data Engineer title and a commitment to unified data platform architecture scope within the Synergy Architect framework. Frame your pipelines as the connective tissue that transforms two separate payment companies into one. Total first-year comp target: $275,000+ (Atlanta) / $330,000+ (NYC).
