**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Global Payments face a design challenge that almost no other company can offer: creating a unified merchant experience across two of the world's largest payment platforms. The $24B Worldpay re-integration means consolidating dashboards, reporting interfaces, onboarding flows, and transaction management tools that 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries rely on daily. This is not incremental feature design — it is full-stack experience architecture for a $9B+ revenue platform.

The Synergy Architect philosophy is deeply relevant to design because the merchant's experience of the integration determines whether they stay or churn. A well-designed unified commerce dashboard that makes Payment Orchestration transparent and intuitive can retain millions in recurring revenue. A confusing, fragmented transition experience can drive merchants to Stripe, Adyen, or Square. Designers who understand payment workflows, merchant mental models, and cross-cultural UX patterns are essential to the Worldpay integration's success — and the design talent market in fintech is tighter than most recruiters will admit.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Design System Unification Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration requires building a unified design system from two completely separate product experiences. I'll be creating the visual and interaction language that 4M+ merchant locations use across 100+ countries. That's design system architecture at a scale few companies can match, and the base should reflect it — I'm targeting $160,000 (Atlanta) or $185,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Merchant Experience Retention Impact:** "The Payment Orchestration layer is only as good as the merchant experience wrapping it. My designs will directly impact whether merchants embrace or resist the unified commerce platform. A 1% improvement in merchant retention during the transition is worth tens of millions in revenue. I'd like the RSU package to reflect that business impact — $100,000-$130,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Cross-Cultural Synergy Architect Design:** "As a Synergy Architect in design, I'll be creating experiences that work across 100+ countries — different languages, different payment cultures, different regulatory disclosure requirements. That cross-cultural design expertise commands a premium in the market, and I'd like to see a sign-on bonus of $15,000-$20,000 to reflect the specialized skill set I bring."

**Lever 4 — Fintech Design Talent Scarcity:** "Product designers who understand payment flows, compliance constraints, and merchant workflows are exceptionally rare. Stripe, Block, and Adyen are all competing for this same talent pool. I'm excited about the Worldpay integration design challenge, but the total comp needs to be within striking distance of those offers to make this the right move."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $160,000 base (Atlanta) / $185,000 (NYC) with $100,000-$130,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the design system unification premium — you are building the visual identity of the largest payment platform merger in history. Push for a $15,000-$20,000 sign-on bonus and request Senior Designer title if scope warrants it. Your accept-at floor should be $130,000 base (Atlanta) / $150,000 (NYC) with at least $65,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for a guaranteed 6-month design leadership review and a commitment to presenting your unified design system work to GPN's executive leadership. The Synergy Architect frame positions design as a revenue-retention function, not a cost center. Total first-year comp target: $230,000+ (Atlanta) / $280,000+ (NYC).
