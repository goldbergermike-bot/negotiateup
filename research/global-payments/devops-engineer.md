**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Global Payments are the infrastructure backbone of the $24B Worldpay re-integration. Merging two of the world's largest payment processing platforms means unifying CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration clusters, monitoring stacks, and deployment practices across data centers spanning 100+ countries. This is not standard DevOps — it is infrastructure integration at planetary scale, where a deployment failure can disrupt transactions for 4M+ merchant locations and directly impact $9B+ in annual revenue.

The Payment Orchestration platform requires infrastructure that can route transactions across multiple acquirers and payment networks with sub-second latency and five-nines availability. The Synergy Architect role for a DevOps engineer is about building the shared infrastructure platform that both legacy GPN and Worldpay engineering teams deploy to — a unified platform that eliminates duplicated infrastructure costs (a key synergy target) while maintaining the reliability that payment processing demands. DevOps engineers who have managed infrastructure migrations at scale during major acquisitions are rare, and GPN's integration timeline makes this expertise urgent.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Infrastructure Integration Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration requires merging two entirely separate infrastructure stacks — different cloud providers, different CI/CD pipelines, different monitoring systems. As a DevOps engineer, I'm the person who makes the unified commerce platform actually work in production. That infrastructure integration scope warrants a base of $175,000 (Atlanta) or $200,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Global Payment Reliability Mandate:** "Payment Orchestration across 100+ countries demands five-nines availability on infrastructure that processes billions of dollars in transactions. The reliability requirements for GPN's unified platform are among the most stringent in the industry. My experience maintaining payment infrastructure at scale directly maps to this mandate, and the RSU package should reflect the critical nature of this work — $120,000-$155,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Infrastructure Savings:** "A core synergy target from the Worldpay deal is eliminating duplicated infrastructure — consolidating data centers, standardizing toolchains, and reducing operational overhead. As a Synergy Architect on the infrastructure side, my work will directly drive cost savings that show up on GPN's income statement. I'd like a performance bonus structure that rewards infrastructure consolidation milestones."

**Lever 4 — DevOps Talent Scarcity in Payments:** "DevOps engineers with payment infrastructure experience and PCI compliance expertise are among the hardest roles to fill in fintech. I'm leaving a stable position to join during the most complex phase of the Worldpay integration — a $20,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus would offset the risk of joining mid-integration and demonstrate GPN's commitment to retaining critical infrastructure talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $175,000 base (Atlanta) / $200,000 (NYC) with $120,000-$155,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the infrastructure integration premium — merging payment infrastructure for a $24B deal is not standard DevOps work. Push for a $20,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus and a guaranteed bonus floor of 15%. Your accept-at floor should be $145,000 base (Atlanta) / $165,000 (NYC) with at least $75,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for an SRE/Principal DevOps title and a commitment to infrastructure leadership scope within the Synergy Architect framework. Frame every infrastructure consolidation project as direct synergy value delivery. Total first-year comp target: $260,000+ (Atlanta) / $310,000+ (NYC).
