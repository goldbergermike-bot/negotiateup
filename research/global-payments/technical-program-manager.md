**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Global Payments during the Worldpay era are running the most consequential integration program in payment technology history. The $24B Worldpay re-integration involves hundreds of engineering workstreams, cross-functional dependencies spanning product, compliance, operations, and merchant success, and execution timelines measured in quarters across 100+ countries. The TPM is the person who holds all of these threads together — tracking dependencies, managing risk, and ensuring that the unified commerce platform ships on schedule.

The Synergy Architect philosophy depends on TPMs because synergies do not capture themselves. Projected cost savings from infrastructure consolidation, revenue uplift from unified merchant experiences, and operational efficiency from combined Payment Orchestration — none of these materialize without disciplined program execution. The TPM translates synergy targets into engineering milestones, escalates integration blockers before they become crises, and provides the executive visibility that keeps the $9B+ revenue engine running while the platform is simultaneously being rebuilt. With 4M+ merchant locations depending on uninterrupted service during the migration, the margin for program management error is effectively zero.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Integration Program Scope Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration is not a standard technical program — it's the largest payment platform consolidation in the industry's history. I'll be managing workstreams that span hundreds of engineers, multiple geographies, and regulatory requirements across 100+ countries. That program scope warrants principal-level TPM compensation, and I'm targeting a base of $195,000 (Atlanta) or $220,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Synergy Realization Accountability:** "As a Synergy Architect TPM, I'm directly accountable for whether projected synergies from the Worldpay deal translate into executed engineering milestones. My program management directly impacts GPN's ability to deliver the cost savings and revenue targets promised to shareholders. The RSU package should reflect that accountability — $160,000-$200,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Payment Orchestration Program Complexity:** "The Payment Orchestration platform requires coordinating across acquiring, processing, settlement, and merchant integration workstreams simultaneously. Each workstream touches 4M+ merchant locations and billions in daily transaction volume. My experience managing complex technical programs in regulated environments maps directly to this challenge, and I'd like a sign-on bonus of $20,000-$30,000 to reflect the premium GPN should place on this expertise."

**Lever 4 — TPM Retention Through Integration Lifecycle:** "Integration programs of this magnitude require TPM continuity — losing institutional knowledge mid-program can set the timeline back by quarters. I'm committed to seeing the Worldpay unified commerce platform through to completion, but I need the compensation to reflect that multi-year commitment. I'd like accelerated first-year vesting and a guaranteed RSU refresh at the 18-month mark."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $195,000 base (Atlanta) / $220,000 (NYC) with $160,000-$200,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the integration program scope premium — the Worldpay re-integration is the largest technical program in payment technology, and the TPM running it should be compensated at the top of market. Push for a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus and accelerated first-year vesting. Your accept-at floor should be $160,000 base (Atlanta) / $185,000 (NYC) with at least $100,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for a Senior/Principal TPM title and a guaranteed 12-month review with RSU refresh eligibility. Position yourself as the Synergy Architect who converts strategy into executed milestones. Total first-year comp target: $320,000+ (Atlanta) / $380,000+ (NYC).
