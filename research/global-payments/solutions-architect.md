**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Global Payments are the bridge between the $24B Worldpay re-integration's technical vision and its merchant-facing reality. You design the integration patterns, API architectures, and data flows that enterprise merchants use to connect to GPN's unified commerce platform. With 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries, each with different technical stacks, compliance requirements, and business needs, the Solutions Architect must design scalable, flexible integration patterns that work universally while accommodating local complexity.

The Payment Orchestration architecture is the Solutions Architect's domain. You define how merchants connect to the routing layer, how transaction data flows through the unified platform, and how GPN's consolidated APIs replace the legacy interfaces from both GPN and Worldpay. The Synergy Architect framing is natural for this role because solutions architecture is literally about creating the connective tissue between systems. Every integration pattern you design that works across both legacy platforms is a direct synergy capture — reducing merchant migration friction, lowering support costs, and accelerating time-to-revenue on the unified platform. GPN's $9B+ revenue depends on merchants successfully adopting the consolidated APIs, and Solutions Architects are the people who make that adoption happen.

### Worldpay Re-Integration — The Synergy Architect Premium

**Lever 1 — Enterprise Integration Complexity Premium:** "The $24B Worldpay re-integration means I'll be designing integration architectures for enterprise merchants who are currently split across two different platforms. Migrating these merchants to the unified commerce platform without disrupting their payment flows is mission-critical. That integration complexity warrants a base of $205,000 (Atlanta) or $230,000 (NYC)."

**Lever 2 — Payment Orchestration API Architecture:** "The Payment Orchestration layer requires a unified API surface that replaces both GPN and Worldpay legacy interfaces. I'll be designing the API architecture that 4M+ merchant locations across 100+ countries integrate against. That's enterprise architecture at a scale that defines the industry standard, and the RSU package should reflect it — $160,000-$200,000 over four years."

**Lever 3 — Synergy Architect Migration Design:** "Every merchant I successfully migrate from legacy systems to the unified platform represents captured synergy value. As a Synergy Architect, I'm directly responsible for the adoption curve of the consolidated platform. I'd like a performance bonus explicitly tied to merchant migration milestones — this aligns my compensation with GPN's synergy realization timeline."

**Lever 4 — Solutions Architecture Talent Premium:** "Solutions Architects who understand both enterprise integration patterns and payment technology are exceptionally rare. My ability to design merchant-facing architectures that satisfy PCI compliance, support cross-border transactions, and scale to GPN's transaction volumes is a skill set that Stripe, Adyen, and the major banks are all competing for. A $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus would demonstrate GPN's commitment to securing this expertise during the critical integration window."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $205,000 base (Atlanta) / $230,000 (NYC) with $160,000-$200,000 RSUs over 4 years. Lead with the enterprise integration complexity premium — designing merchant migration architectures for a $24B payment platform merger is principal-level scope. Push for a $25,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus and request a title of "Principal Solutions Architect" if scope includes cross-platform API design. Your accept-at floor should be $170,000 base (Atlanta) / $195,000 (NYC) with at least $100,000 RSU. If they counter below, negotiate for a guaranteed bonus floor of 18% and a defined scope commitment to Payment Orchestration API architecture. Position yourself as the Synergy Architect who determines merchant adoption velocity. Total first-year comp target: $330,000+ (Atlanta) / $390,000+ (NYC).
