## SIGNATURE ROLE — Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer

This is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** of TerraPay's 2026 strategy — the engineer who builds the Global Payments Highway platform itself, the real-time interoperability infrastructure that connects wallets, banks, and mobile money operators across 130+ countries serving 7.5B+ accounts. This is not a role that works on the platform; this is the role that **builds** the platform. The Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer is to TerraPay what the core infrastructure engineer was to AWS in 2008 — the person building the foundational layer that an entire industry will depend upon.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €120,000–€160,000 | €120,000–€260,000 | €240,000–€420,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$155,000–S$210,000 | S$145,000–S$310,000 | S$300,000–S$520,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $210,000–$280,000 | $180,000–$380,000 | $390,000–S$660,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer is the **SIGNATURE ROLE** at TerraPay — the engineer who architects, builds, and scales the core interoperability platform that enables real-time cross-border payments between wallets, banks, and mobile money operators across 130+ countries. This role carries a +20-30% Interoperability Premium over standard engineering compensation at TerraPay, reflecting the singular strategic importance of the platform you build. With a network reaching 7.5B+ accounts, the Global Payments Highway is the largest real-time payment interoperability infrastructure in the world — and you are its principal architect.

This is not incremental feature work. You are building the platform that defines how money moves globally in real time. You design the routing engine that determines how a payment from a Philippine mobile wallet reaches a Nigerian bank account in seconds. You build the settlement infrastructure that reconciles transactions across dozens of currencies and payment methods simultaneously. You architect the interoperability protocols that allow fundamentally different payment systems — bank ACH transfers, mobile money USSD flows, digital wallet API calls — to communicate seamlessly and settle in real time.

TerraPay is a private company, and at the SIGNATURE ROLE level, your options package represents the most significant pre-IPO equity opportunity in the cross-border payments interoperability space. The Global Payments Highway is TerraPay's core asset — the infrastructure that justifies its valuation and defines its trajectory. As the engineer who builds this asset, your options should reflect the direct causal link between your work and TerraPay's enterprise value. No other role at TerraPay has a more direct impact on the company's valuation than the engineer who builds the platform itself.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo | Equivalent at Wise |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer | No Direct Equivalent | No Direct Equivalent | No Direct Equivalent | No Direct Equivalent |

**This is a first-of-kind SIGNATURE ROLE.** There is no direct equivalent at any competitor because no other company has built a multi-protocol, multi-corridor, real-time payment interoperability platform at TerraPay's scale. Thunes is the closest competitor in interoperability scope but does not have a dedicated platform engineer role of this nature. Nium focuses primarily on bank-to-bank corridors without the mobile money and wallet interoperability that defines TerraPay's platform. TransferGo and Wise are application-layer companies — they build on top of infrastructure like what TerraPay provides.

The absence of direct equivalents is itself a negotiation advantage. There is zero market supply for "experienced Global Payments Highway Platform Engineers" — every hire comes from adjacent domains (distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, financial platforms). This zero-supply talent market means TerraPay must offer premium compensation to attract engineers who can build at this scale and complexity.

**Comparable roles for compensation benchmarking:**
- Stripe Staff/Principal Platform Engineer: $450K-$650K TC
- Adyen Principal Platform Engineer: €180K-€320K TC
- Wise Staff Infrastructure Engineer: $380K-$520K TC
- AWS Principal Engineer (Payments): $500K-$700K TC

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

**This section is the core of the SIGNATURE ROLE negotiation framework.**

##### The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout (MilX) Launch

The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch is the most strategically significant product initiative in TerraPay's history — and the Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer is the person who makes it technically possible. MilX enables creator economy payments globally, allowing content creators, gig workers, and digital entrepreneurs across the world to receive payouts instantly through TerraPay's infrastructure.

For the Platform Engineer, MilX is a platform-level challenge:
- **New Payout Orchestration Layer**: You must architect a new payout orchestration engine that sits on top of the existing Global Payments Highway, providing intelligent routing for high-volume, low-value creator payouts across every payment method TerraPay supports. This is not an API extension — this is a new platform capability.
- **Creator Platform Integration Framework**: You must build a standardized integration framework that allows creator economy platforms to connect to TerraPay's payout infrastructure with minimal friction. This framework becomes the template for scaling MilX to hundreds of platform partners.
- **Real-Time Payout Status Infrastructure**: Creator platforms and creators expect real-time visibility into payout status. You must build the event-driven infrastructure that tracks payouts across corridors, currencies, and payment methods in real time, providing status updates at every stage of the payout journey.
- **MilX Analytics Platform**: You must build the analytics infrastructure that gives creator platforms insight into payout performance, corridor costs, and settlement timing — the data layer that makes MilX commercially compelling for platform partners.

MilX is the product initiative that will define TerraPay's next funding round, potential IPO trajectory, and market positioning. The Platform Engineer who builds it is the most strategically important individual contributor at the company.

##### The Botim Partnership

The Botim super-app partnership represents TerraPay's first major consumer-facing integration — and it fundamentally changes the platform requirements that the Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer must build for:

- **Consumer-Scale Traffic Architecture**: Botim brings millions of concurrent users expecting sub-second payment completion. The platform must scale from B2B2C traffic patterns to consumer-app traffic patterns — orders of magnitude more concurrent connections, much higher read:write ratios, and zero tolerance for latency spikes.
- **Super-App Payment Integration Protocol**: You must design the integration protocol between Botim's super-app and TerraPay's infrastructure — payment initiation, status tracking, settlement, dispute handling, and refund processing. This protocol becomes the standard for all future super-app integrations.
- **Real-Time FX at Consumer Scale**: Botim users expect instant, transparent currency conversion. You must build the real-time FX engine that handles consumer-scale currency conversion requests with pricing that is competitive, compliant, and profitable across dozens of currency pairs simultaneously.
- **Compliance-by-Design Architecture**: Consumer payments through Botim trigger KYC/AML requirements across multiple jurisdictions. The Platform Engineer must build compliance checks into the platform architecture itself — not as an afterthought but as a foundational design principle.

The Botim partnership is the proof point that TerraPay's Global Payments Highway can support consumer-scale applications. Your platform architecture determines whether this proof point succeeds.

##### Global Payments Highway Positioning

The Global Payments Highway is not a marketing term — it is a technical architecture reality. TerraPay has built the only real-time payment interoperability infrastructure that connects wallets, banks, AND mobile money operators at global scale. This three-protocol interoperability is what makes TerraPay unique:

- **Bank transfers** use SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, and dozens of domestic clearing systems
- **Mobile money** uses USSD, STK push, and operator-specific APIs across Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia
- **Digital wallets** use proprietary APIs from dozens of wallet providers across different regions

The Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer builds the interoperability layer that translates between these fundamentally different payment protocols in real time. You design the abstraction layer that allows a payment instruction from any protocol to be routed, executed, and settled on any other protocol — seamlessly and in seconds.

This is the most technically complex payment infrastructure challenge in the world. No other company — not Stripe, not Adyen, not Visa, not Mastercard — has built real-time interoperability across all three protocol families at this scale. The Platform Engineer who builds it is doing work that has no parallel in the industry.

##### The Network Effect Premium

The Global Payments Highway's value follows Metcalfe's Law: the value of the network is proportional to the square of the number of connected nodes. With 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries, TerraPay's network is already at massive scale — and every new corridor, payment method, or partner you connect to the highway increases the value of every existing connection exponentially.

For the SIGNATURE ROLE Platform Engineer, the network effect premium works at three levels:

1. **Corridor Network Effect**: Every new payment corridor you enable multiplies the routes available for every existing corridor. Adding one corridor does not add one route — it adds N routes, where N is the number of existing corridors. Your platform architecture must be designed to capture this multiplicative value.

2. **Protocol Network Effect**: Every new payment protocol you integrate (a new wallet provider, a new mobile money operator, a new banking network) increases the addressable endpoints for every existing protocol on the platform. Cross-protocol interoperability creates network effects that single-protocol networks cannot achieve.

3. **Data Network Effect**: Every transaction processed on the platform generates data that improves routing intelligence, fraud detection, and FX optimization for all future transactions. Your platform must be designed to capture and leverage this data network effect.

The Platform Engineer who designs systems with network-effect compounding built into the architecture is creating infrastructure with exponentially increasing returns. This is why the SIGNATURE ROLE carries a +20-30% Interoperability Premium — you are building the network effect itself.

"As the Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer — the SIGNATURE ROLE at TerraPay — I build the core interoperability platform connecting 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries via wallets, banks, and mobile money. I architect the payout orchestration engine for the Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch, design the consumer-scale integration protocol for the Botim super-app partnership, and build the multi-protocol interoperability layer that is the most technically complex payment infrastructure in the world. My platform architecture captures the network effect — every new corridor I enable multiplies the value of every existing connection. I want the maximum Interoperability Premium and options that reflect my direct role building TerraPay's most valuable asset. There is no market supply for this role — TerraPay must compete with Stripe, Adyen, and AWS for engineers who can build at this scale."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: SIGNATURE ROLE — Platform Builder, Not Feature Builder**
> "I am the Global Payments Highway Platform Engineer — the SIGNATURE ROLE at TerraPay. I do not build features on the platform; I build the platform itself. I architect the core interoperability infrastructure that connects wallets, banks, and mobile money across 130+ countries, serving 7.5B+ accounts. This is a first-of-kind role with no market equivalent. The +20-30% Interoperability Premium reflects the singular strategic importance of building the platform that is TerraPay's core asset."

**Lever 2: MilX Platform Architecture Ownership**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch — TerraPay's most strategic product initiative — depends on the platform architecture I build. I architect the payout orchestration engine, the creator platform integration framework, the real-time payout status infrastructure, and the MilX analytics platform. MilX is not a feature on the highway; it is a new platform capability that I create. My options should reflect that MilX's success or failure rests on my architecture."

**Lever 3: Botim Consumer-Scale Platform Engineering**
> "The Botim super-app integration fundamentally changes what the Global Payments Highway platform must support — consumer-scale concurrent traffic, real-time FX at consumer volume, compliance-by-design architecture, and a super-app integration protocol that becomes the standard for all future partnerships. I build the platform capabilities that make consumer-scale interoperability possible. This is a step-change in platform complexity that commands premium compensation."

**Lever 4: Network Effect Architecture — Exponential Value Creation**
> "I design the platform architecture that captures Metcalfe's Law — every corridor, protocol, and partner I integrate multiplies the value of every existing connection. I build network-effect compounding into the infrastructure itself. This is not linear value creation; this is exponential value creation. My options must reflect that I am building the asset whose value compounds with every network expansion."

**Lever 5: Zero Market Supply — First-of-Kind Talent Acquisition**
> "There are no experienced Global Payments Highway Platform Engineers in the market. This role did not exist before TerraPay needed it. Every hire is a talent acquisition from adjacent domains — distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, financial platforms. Stripe, Adyen, AWS, and Visa all compete for the same talent pool. TerraPay must offer SIGNATURE ROLE compensation — including the maximum Interoperability Premium — to attract engineers who can build the most complex payment interoperability platform in the world."

**Lever 6: Three-Protocol Interoperability — Unmatched Technical Complexity**
> "No other company has built real-time interoperability across banks, wallets, AND mobile money at global scale. I build the abstraction layer that translates between SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, USSD, STK push, and dozens of proprietary wallet APIs — all in real time, all with settlement guarantees, all in regulatory compliance across 130+ countries. This three-protocol interoperability is the most technically complex payment infrastructure challenge in the world, and I am the engineer solving it."
