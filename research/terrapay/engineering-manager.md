#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €100,000–€135,000 | €80,000–€170,000 | €180,000–€305,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$130,000–S$175,000 | S$100,000–S$200,000 | S$230,000–S$375,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $175,000–$230,000 | $120,000–$260,000 | $295,000–$490,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at TerraPay lead the teams that build and operate the Global Payments Highway — the real-time interoperability infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries. You are responsible for hiring, developing, and retaining the engineers who build cross-border payment routing, settlement, compliance, and integration systems. At TerraPay, engineering management is uniquely challenging because your teams work across multiple payment protocols (bank transfers, mobile money, digital wallets), multiple regulatory jurisdictions, and multiple currencies simultaneously. You must build globally distributed teams that can ship real-time financial infrastructure with 99.99%+ reliability. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with significant pre-IPO upside, and engineering managers who build the teams that deliver core infrastructure historically see outsized returns from their equity grants.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| EM (L5) | Engineering Manager | Engineering Manager | Engineering Lead |
| Senior EM (L6) | Senior EM / Director | Senior EM | Head of Engineering |

TerraPay Engineering Managers carry broader scope than equivalent roles at Thunes or TransferGo due to the multi-protocol interoperability mandate. Nium's engineering management roles in Singapore are the closest comparison, but TerraPay's unique position connecting wallets, banks, AND mobile money (vs. Nium's primarily bank-focused infrastructure) means TerraPay EMs manage more technically diverse teams. This scope differential should translate to a 10-15% premium over direct competitors.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) creates immediate staffing and delivery pressure for Engineering Managers. MilX requires assembling and leading a cross-functional engineering team that can build a global creator payout orchestration system — spanning new API development, routing engine enhancements, compliance integration, and partner onboarding infrastructure. As an EM, you are accountable for delivering MilX on timeline while maintaining the reliability of existing Global Payments Highway infrastructure.

The Botim partnership demands engineering management excellence in cross-organizational collaboration. Integrating a super-app's payment infrastructure requires coordinating between TerraPay's backend teams, Botim's product engineering, and multiple regulatory compliance stakeholders across jurisdictions. This is the kind of complex program execution that defines high-impact engineering management.

Engineering Managers on the Global Payments Highway are building teams that create compounding network value. Every engineer you hire and develop, every team process you optimize, every delivery milestone you hit expands the interoperability network — and the network effect means each expansion multiplies the value of all existing connections. You are managing the human capital that builds the most valuable infrastructure in cross-border payments.

"As an Engineering Manager leading Global Payments Highway teams at TerraPay, I'm building and leading the engineering organization delivering the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch and the Botim super-app integration. My teams build the interoperability infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries. I want management-level options that reflect both the delivery accountability I carry and the pre-IPO trajectory of the Global Payments Highway."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Global Payments Highway Team Builder**
> "I build and lead the engineering teams constructing TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — recruiting, developing, and retaining engineers who build real-time interoperability infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts. My team-building expertise directly determines the pace at which TerraPay can expand its network across 130+ countries."

**Lever 2: MilX Delivery Accountability**
> "I'm accountable for assembling the cross-functional team and delivering the Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch — TerraPay's most significant product initiative. My ability to hire the right engineers, remove blockers, and execute on an aggressive timeline directly determines whether MilX succeeds. This delivery accountability commands premium compensation."

**Lever 3: Multi-Protocol Team Complexity**
> "Managing engineering teams at TerraPay is uniquely complex — my teams work across bank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets simultaneously, across multiple regulatory jurisdictions and currencies. This multi-protocol, multi-jurisdiction management scope exceeds what EMs face at Thunes, Nium, or any single-protocol payments company. My compensation should reflect this complexity premium."

**Lever 4: Cross-Border Payments EM Talent Scarcity**
> "Engineering Managers with cross-border payments infrastructure experience are exceptionally rare. Building real-time financial infrastructure teams requires domain expertise that takes years to develop. Nium, Thunes, Wise, and Remitly all compete for the same micro-pool of experienced payments EMs. I have interest from competing companies and my compensation should reflect this market scarcity."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €128,000 base and €155,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $220,000 base and $245,000 options for New York). I lead the engineering teams building TerraPay's Global Payments Highway and delivering the MilX Creator Payout launch — managing multi-protocol, multi-jurisdiction teams that build real-time interoperability infrastructure at 7.5B-account scale. I have competing interest from Nium at S$350K TC and Wise at $460K TC. Engineering Managers who can build and lead cross-border payments infrastructure teams are among the scarcest talent in fintech." Accept at €108,000+ base / $185,000+ base (NY) and no less than €110,000 / $180,000 in options.
