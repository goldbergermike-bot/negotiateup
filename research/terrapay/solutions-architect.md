| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €90,000–€125,000 | €55,000–€130,000 | €145,000–€255,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at TerraPay are the bridge between the Global Payments Highway platform and every partner that connects to it — designing the integration architectures that enable wallets, banks, mobile money operators, and platforms to plug into TerraPay's real-time interoperability network. Every new partner integration you architect expands the network by adding new payment corridors, and the network effect means each integration multiplies the value of all existing connections. You work at the intersection of technical architecture and business development, designing solutions that are technically sound, regulatory compliant, and commercially viable across 130+ countries. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with pre-IPO upside, and Solutions Architects who drive partner integrations — the direct driver of network growth — create some of the most measurable value in the organization.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Solutions Architect | Solutions Engineer | Solutions Architect | Integration Lead |
| Senior Solutions Architect | Principal Solutions | Senior SA | Head of Integrations |

TerraPay Solutions Architect compensation should benchmark above Thunes and at or above Nium due to the breadth of integration scenarios — wallets, banks, AND mobile money require fundamentally different integration patterns. The role's direct impact on network growth (every integration = network expansion) creates stronger compensation justification than equivalent roles at competitors with narrower integration surfaces.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) is a partner integration sprint for Solutions Architects. MilX requires designing integration architectures for creator economy platforms — content platforms, gig economy marketplaces, social media companies — that need to pay creators globally through TerraPay's infrastructure. Each platform has unique payout requirements, data formats, compliance needs, and technical constraints. Solutions Architects design the integration blueprints that make MilX partnerships technically viable and commercially scalable.

The Botim partnership is a flagship Solutions Architecture engagement. Integrating a super-app's entire payment flow into TerraPay's infrastructure requires designing a comprehensive integration architecture — payment initiation, status tracking, settlement, dispute handling, and compliance reporting across multiple jurisdictions. This integration becomes the template for future super-app partnerships, making the Solutions Architect's design decisions foundational for an entire partner category.

Solutions Architects on the Global Payments Highway are the architects of network growth. Every integration you design adds a new node to the interoperability network, and the network effect means each new node increases the value of every existing node. You are designing the connection points through which the Global Payments Highway grows — making your work the most direct driver of TerraPay's network-effect value creation.

"As a Solutions Architect designing partner integrations for TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I architect the connections that grow the interoperability network — including the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout platform integrations and the Botim super-app integration blueprint. Every integration I design adds network-effect value across 7.5B+ accounts. I want options reflecting my direct role as the architect of network growth."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Network Growth Architect**
> "I design the partner integrations that directly grow TerraPay's interoperability network — every integration I architect adds a new node to the Global Payments Highway, and the network effect means each new node multiplies the value of every existing connection across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries. My work is the most direct driver of network-effect value creation."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Platform Integration Design**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch requires integrating creator economy platforms into TerraPay's infrastructure — each with unique payout requirements, data formats, and compliance needs. I design the integration architectures that make these partnerships technically viable and commercially scalable. MilX's success depends on my integration blueprints."

**Lever 3: Botim Super-App Integration Blueprint**
> "The Botim super-app integration is a flagship Solutions Architecture engagement — designing the comprehensive integration architecture for payment initiation, settlement, and compliance across jurisdictions. My design becomes the template for all future super-app partnerships. This blueprint-setting work commands premium compensation."

**Lever 4: Multi-Protocol Integration Expertise**
> "I design integrations across wallets, banks, and mobile money simultaneously — fundamentally different payment protocols requiring different integration patterns, compliance approaches, and technical architectures. This multi-protocol integration expertise is rare and directly drives TerraPay's competitive advantage as the only truly multi-protocol interoperability platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €118,000 base and €120,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $198,000 base and $180,000 options for New York). I architect the partner integrations that directly grow TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — designing the MilX Creator Payout platform integrations and the Botim super-app integration blueprint. Every integration I design multiplies network-effect value across 7.5B+ accounts. I have competing interest from Nium at S$295K TC and Thunes at comparable levels." Accept at €98,000+ base / $168,000+ base (NY) and no less than €82,000 / $130,000 in options.
