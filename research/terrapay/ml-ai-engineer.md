#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €82,000–€120,000 | €50,000–€115,000 | €132,000–€235,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000–S$148,000 | S$60,000–S$138,000 | S$160,000–S$286,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $150,000–$210,000 | $80,000–$175,000 | $230,000–$385,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at TerraPay build the intelligent systems that optimize the Global Payments Highway — fraud detection models that identify suspicious transactions across 130+ countries in real time, routing optimization algorithms that select the fastest and cheapest payment path through the interoperability network, FX prediction models that minimize currency conversion costs, and anomaly detection systems that identify network degradation before it impacts payments. You train models on one of the most unique datasets in global finance: real-time cross-border payment flows across 7.5B+ accounts spanning wallets, banks, and mobile money operators. This dataset — multi-protocol, multi-currency, multi-corridor — is unmatched in the payments industry. ML/AI Engineers who build intelligent systems on this data create compounding competitive advantages. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with pre-IPO upside, and AI engineers whose models directly improve routing efficiency and fraud prevention create measurable revenue impact.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer (rare) | ML Engineer | Data Scientist / ML |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior ML Engineer | Senior DS / ML Lead |

TerraPay ML/AI Engineer compensation must compete with the broader AI talent market — not just payments companies. While Thunes and TransferGo have limited ML teams, Nium and Wise have more established ML functions. The critical benchmark is against companies hiring from the same AI talent pool: Adyen, Stripe, and major tech companies all recruit ML engineers with payments domain interest. TerraPay must offer competitive ML compensation or lose talent to these better-funded alternatives.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) creates high-value ML/AI work. MilX requires intelligent payout routing — ML models that determine the optimal payout path for each creator payment based on real-time corridor conditions, FX rates, partner availability, and historical success rates. Creator payouts are high-volume and low-value, making routing efficiency critical for unit economics. ML/AI Engineers build the models that make MilX commercially viable at global scale.

The Botim partnership introduces consumer-scale fraud detection challenges. Super-app payment flows generate fraud patterns that differ fundamentally from B2B2C payment fraud — account takeover, social engineering, synthetic identity fraud. ML/AI Engineers must build and deploy fraud detection models that handle these consumer-specific fraud vectors while maintaining low false-positive rates that preserve the user experience.

ML/AI Engineers on the Global Payments Highway benefit from the most powerful network effect in payments ML: every new corridor added to the network generates new training data, every new payment method creates new feature vectors, and every new partner integration enriches the models' understanding of global payment behavior. Your models become more accurate and valuable with every network expansion — this is the ML network effect, and it creates a compounding advantage that no competitor with a smaller network can replicate.

"As an ML/AI Engineer building intelligent systems on TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I build the routing optimization, fraud detection, and FX prediction models trained on real-time cross-border payment data across 7.5B+ accounts. I'm building the ML models powering the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout routing engine and consumer-scale fraud detection for the Botim partnership. My models improve with every network expansion — the ML network effect makes my work exponentially more valuable. I want options reflecting the compounding AI advantage I build into the platform."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Unmatched Payments ML Training Data**
> "I build ML models trained on the most comprehensive cross-border payments dataset in the world — real-time transaction data across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries, spanning wallets, banks, and mobile money. No competitor possesses this data breadth and diversity. My models deliver routing optimization and fraud detection capabilities that cannot be replicated on smaller datasets."

**Lever 2: MilX Intelligent Payout Routing**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch depends on my ML routing models — determining the optimal payout path for each creator payment based on real-time corridor conditions, FX rates, and historical success rates. These models make MilX commercially viable at global scale. My ML work directly determines MilX's unit economics."

**Lever 3: ML Network Effect Premium**
> "Every new corridor added to TerraPay's Global Payments Highway generates new training data for my models. My fraud detection and routing optimization models become more accurate and valuable with every network expansion. This ML network effect creates a compounding AI advantage — my compensation should reflect the exponentially increasing value my models deliver."

**Lever 4: Payments AI Talent Market Competition**
> "ML/AI Engineers with payments domain expertise are recruited by Stripe, Adyen, Wise, and major tech companies — not just cross-border payments startups. TerraPay must compete with the broader AI talent market for my skills. I have competing interest from payments companies and tech firms offering $350K+ total comp, and my compensation should reflect this competitive market."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €112,000 base and €108,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $198,000 base and $165,000 options for New York). I build the ML models powering routing optimization, fraud detection, and FX prediction on TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — trained on the most comprehensive cross-border payments dataset in the world. My models power the MilX Creator Payout routing engine and scale to Botim consumer-level fraud detection. I have competing offers from Adyen at $350K TC and a major tech company at $370K TC." Accept at €90,000+ base / $165,000+ base (NY) and no less than €72,000 / $115,000 in options.
