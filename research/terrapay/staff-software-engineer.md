#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €110,000–€145,000 | €100,000–€200,000 | €210,000–€345,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$140,000–S$185,000 | S$120,000–S$240,000 | S$260,000–S$425,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $195,000–$255,000 | $150,000–$310,000 | $345,000–$565,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at TerraPay are the principal architects of the Global Payments Highway — the engineers who set the technical direction for the entire interoperability platform. At the staff level, you are not just building systems; you are defining how real-time cross-border payments work at planetary scale. You make the architectural decisions that determine whether TerraPay's network of 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries can process payments in real time with 99.99%+ reliability. Staff engineers at infrastructure-layer payments companies like TerraPay carry outsized influence — your technical decisions become industry standards. As a private company, TerraPay's options at the staff level represent the most significant pre-IPO equity opportunity in the cross-border payments interoperability space. Your compensation must reflect that you are one of the few engineers in the world capable of architecting real-time, multi-protocol, multi-currency, multi-regulatory payment interoperability at this scale.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo | Equivalent at Wise |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Staff SWE (L5) | Principal Engineer | Staff SDE | Principal Developer | Staff Engineer |
| Staff SWE (L5+) | Distinguished Engineer | Principal SDE | N/A | Senior Staff |

At the staff level, TerraPay's compensation must compete with larger, better-funded fintech companies. Wise, Remitly, and dLocal all recruit from the same talent pool for cross-border payments expertise. Nium's Singapore office pays competitive staff-level salaries but TerraPay's broader interoperability mandate (wallets + banks + mobile money vs. Nium's bank-focused approach) creates a technically more complex and therefore more valuable role. Staff engineers at TerraPay should benchmark against both payments-specific companies and broader fintech infrastructure companies — the architectural complexity of the Global Payments Highway rivals that of any payments platform globally.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) is an initiative that requires staff-level architectural leadership. MilX is not simply adding a new payment type — it represents a new class of high-volume, low-value, globally distributed payouts that require fundamentally different routing strategies, settlement approaches, and FX optimization. A Staff Software Engineer will architect the MilX payout orchestration engine, determining how creator payouts are routed through the optimal combination of corridors, currencies, and payment methods to maximize speed and minimize cost.

The Botim partnership at the staff level means defining the integration architecture between a consumer-facing super-app and TerraPay's B2B2C infrastructure. This is a technical challenge that spans API design, traffic management, data architecture, and compliance engineering — the kind of cross-cutting architectural work that only staff-level engineers can drive.

As the architect of the Global Payments Highway, a Staff Software Engineer at TerraPay is designing the interoperability standard for global digital payments. The network effect is the critical concept: every new corridor, every new payment method, every new partner integrated into the highway increases the value of every existing connection exponentially. Staff engineers who design systems with network-effect compounding built into their architecture are creating infrastructure with multiplicative returns — this is the most valuable engineering work in cross-border payments.

"As a Staff Software Engineer architecting TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I define the technical direction for the interoperability platform connecting 7.5B+ accounts. I'm leading the architectural design for the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout engine and the Botim super-app integration architecture. My decisions shape how real-time cross-border payments work at planetary scale — I want staff-level options that capture the full pre-IPO upside of the most valuable interoperability infrastructure in global payments."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Principal Architect of the Global Payments Highway**
> "I set the technical direction for TerraPay's entire interoperability platform — the Global Payments Highway connecting 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries via wallets, banks, and mobile money. My architectural decisions become the industry standard for real-time cross-border payments. There are fewer than a handful of engineers globally with the expertise to architect multi-protocol payment interoperability at this scale."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Architecture Leadership**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch requires a new payout orchestration architecture — high-volume, low-value, globally distributed payouts with novel routing strategies. I'm the staff engineer architecting this engine. MilX will drive the transaction volume growth that defines TerraPay's next valuation milestone."

**Lever 3: Interoperability Network Effect Design**
> "I design systems where network effects are architecturally embedded — every new corridor, payment method, and partner integration compounds the value of every existing connection. This is the most valuable engineering work in cross-border payments because it creates multiplicative returns. My compensation should reflect the compounding value I architect into the platform."

**Lever 4: Ultra-Scarce Staff-Level Cross-Border Expertise**
> "Staff engineers with real-time cross-border payments interoperability expertise are among the scarcest talent in fintech. Wise, Nium, Thunes, Remitly, and dLocal all compete for this same micro-pool of talent. I have competing interest from multiple cross-border payments companies — TerraPay must offer staff-level compensation that reflects both market scarcity and the strategic significance of the Global Payments Highway."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €138,000 base and €185,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $245,000 base and $290,000 options for New York). I architect the Global Payments Highway — the interoperability platform connecting 7.5B+ accounts and powering the MilX Creator Payout launch. I define the technical direction for real-time cross-border payments at planetary scale. I have competing interest from Wise at $520K TC, Nium at S$400K TC, and Remitly at $480K TC. Staff engineers who architect network-effect interoperability infrastructure at this scale are virtually irreplaceable." Accept at €118,000+ base / $210,000+ base (NY) and no less than €140,000 / $220,000 in options.
