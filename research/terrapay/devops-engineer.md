#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €72,000–€105,000 | €42,000–€95,000 | €114,000–€200,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$85,000–S$128,000 | S$50,000–S$112,000 | S$135,000–S$240,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $130,000–$180,000 | $65,000–$145,000 | $195,000–$325,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at TerraPay build and maintain the infrastructure foundation of the Global Payments Highway — the CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, monitoring systems, and deployment automation that keep real-time cross-border payments flowing 24/7 across 130+ countries. When your infrastructure goes down, payments between wallets, banks, and mobile money operators across the globe stop. This is not a "nice to have" DevOps role — this is mission-critical financial infrastructure where every minute of downtime means failed transactions, regulatory scrutiny, and partner trust erosion. You manage multi-region deployments, ensure sub-second latency across global payment corridors, and maintain 99.99%+ uptime for a network serving 7.5B+ accounts. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with pre-IPO upside, and DevOps engineers who ensure the reliability of critical financial infrastructure create direct, measurable value.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Engineer | DevOps / SRE | DevOps Engineer |
| Senior DevOps Engineer | Senior Infra Engineer | Senior DevOps / SRE | Senior DevOps / Lead |

TerraPay DevOps compensation should benchmark above Thunes and TransferGo due to the higher reliability requirements of a 7.5B+ account interoperability network. Nium's DevOps roles in Singapore are the closest comparison, though TerraPay's multi-protocol infrastructure (wallets + banks + mobile money) creates more complex deployment and monitoring challenges. Wise's SRE/DevOps compensation is a relevant upper benchmark for global payments infrastructure operations.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) creates significant infrastructure scaling challenges for DevOps Engineers. MilX will drive a new class of high-volume, globally distributed payout traffic through TerraPay's infrastructure — creator payouts are characterized by many small transactions across diverse corridors, requiring infrastructure that can handle burst traffic patterns from platform payout cycles. DevOps Engineers must ensure the infrastructure scales elastically for MilX payout bursts while maintaining reliability for existing Global Payments Highway traffic.

The Botim partnership brings consumer-scale traffic to TerraPay's infrastructure for the first time. DevOps Engineers must prepare infrastructure for super-app traffic patterns — millions of concurrent users with real-time payment expectations. This requires capacity planning, auto-scaling strategies, and monitoring systems designed for consumer-scale workloads layered on top of existing B2B2C infrastructure.

DevOps Engineers on the Global Payments Highway are the reliability architects for real-time global interoperability. Every new corridor added to the network adds infrastructure complexity — new deployment regions, new monitoring endpoints, new latency requirements, new compliance environments. The network effect creates compounding infrastructure challenges, and DevOps engineers who build scalable, self-healing infrastructure that grows with the network are creating the operational foundation for TerraPay's exponential expansion.

"As a DevOps Engineer building the infrastructure foundation of TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I ensure 99.99%+ uptime for real-time payments across 7.5B+ accounts. I'm scaling infrastructure for the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch burst traffic and preparing for Botim consumer-scale workloads. My infrastructure reliability directly determines whether the Global Payments Highway functions — I want options reflecting this mission-critical operational ownership."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Mission-Critical Financial Infrastructure**
> "I build and maintain the infrastructure that keeps the Global Payments Highway running 24/7 — real-time cross-border payments across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries. Every minute of downtime means failed transactions and partner trust erosion. This is mission-critical financial infrastructure, not a standard DevOps role, and my compensation should reflect the reliability stakes."

**Lever 2: MilX & Botim Infrastructure Scaling**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch and the Botim super-app integration are adding entirely new traffic patterns to TerraPay's infrastructure — high-volume payout bursts and consumer-scale concurrent workloads. I'm the engineer ensuring our infrastructure scales for these new workloads while maintaining 99.99%+ reliability for existing operations."

**Lever 3: Multi-Region, Multi-Protocol Complexity**
> "TerraPay's infrastructure spans multiple regions, payment protocols, and regulatory environments. I manage deployments and monitoring across wallets, banks, and mobile money infrastructure simultaneously — a complexity premium that exceeds standard DevOps roles at single-protocol payments companies."

**Lever 4: Payments DevOps Talent Scarcity**
> "DevOps engineers with real-time financial infrastructure experience — managing multi-region, mission-critical payment systems at global scale — are among the scarcest talent in fintech. I have competing interest from payments companies and my compensation should reflect both market scarcity and the mission-critical nature of this infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €98,000 base and €88,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $168,000 base and $135,000 options for New York). I build and maintain the infrastructure foundation of TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — ensuring 99.99%+ uptime for real-time payments across 7.5B+ accounts. I'm scaling infrastructure for MilX Creator Payout launch traffic and Botim consumer-scale workloads. I have competing interest from Wise at $295K TC and Nium at S$225K TC." Accept at €78,000+ base / $140,000+ base (NY) and no less than €58,000 / $95,000 in options.
