#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €75,000–€108,000 | €45,000–€100,000 | €120,000–€208,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$90,000–S$135,000 | S$55,000–S$120,000 | S$145,000–S$255,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $135,000–$185,000 | $70,000–$155,000 | $205,000–$340,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at TerraPay extract actionable intelligence from one of the most unique datasets in global finance — real-time cross-border payment flows across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries, spanning wallets, banks, and mobile money operators. This dataset captures how money moves globally in real time, across every payment protocol and currency pair. You build models for corridor optimization, fraud detection, FX rate prediction, transaction routing intelligence, and partner performance analytics. At TerraPay, data science is not a support function — it is a core competitive advantage. The insights you generate determine which corridors to prioritize, how to price transactions, where fraud risks concentrate, and how to optimize routing for speed and cost. As a private company, your options carry pre-IPO upside proportional to the data-driven value you create for the interoperability network.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Data Scientist | Data Analyst / Scientist | Data Scientist | Data Analyst |
| Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Scientist | Senior Data Analyst |

TerraPay's data science roles carry more scope than equivalents at Thunes or TransferGo due to the sheer breadth of payment protocols and corridors covered. Nium's data science team in Singapore is the closest comparison, but TerraPay's inclusion of mobile money data alongside bank and wallet data creates a uniquely comprehensive global payments dataset. Wise offers competitive DS salaries and is a relevant benchmark for data science on cross-border payment flows at scale.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) creates high-impact data science work. MilX requires building predictive models for creator payout routing — determining the optimal path for each payout based on cost, speed, reliability, and currency conversion rates. Data Scientists must analyze creator payout patterns across platforms and geographies to optimize the payout orchestration engine. This is a new data domain for TerraPay, and the DS team defines the analytics framework from scratch.

The Botim partnership generates consumer-scale transaction data flowing through TerraPay's infrastructure for the first time. Data Scientists analyze Botim payment patterns to optimize routing, detect fraud, and extract insights about super-app payment behavior. This consumer-scale data combined with TerraPay's existing B2B2C data creates an unparalleled dataset for understanding how money moves globally.

Data Scientists on the Global Payments Highway sit on the most comprehensive real-time cross-border payments dataset in the world. Every new corridor added to the network enriches the dataset, improving model accuracy and generating new insights — this is the data network effect. Models trained on TerraPay's global payments data become more accurate and valuable with every new connection, creating a compounding data advantage that no competitor can replicate.

"As a Data Scientist extracting intelligence from TerraPay's Global Payments Highway data, I build the models powering corridor optimization, fraud detection, and routing intelligence for the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch. My analysis of 7.5B+ account payment flows across 130+ countries — including the Botim super-app data — generates insights that no competitor can match. I want options reflecting my contribution to TerraPay's compounding data network effect."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Unparalleled Global Payments Dataset**
> "I work with the most comprehensive real-time cross-border payments dataset in the world — 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries, spanning wallets, banks, and mobile money. Every model I build leverages data that no competitor possesses. This unique data access justifies premium compensation."

**Lever 2: MilX Payout Routing Intelligence**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch depends on my predictive routing models — determining the optimal payout path for each creator payment based on cost, speed, reliability, and FX rates. I'm defining the analytics framework for an entirely new payout vertical from scratch."

**Lever 3: Data Network Effect Premium**
> "Every new corridor added to TerraPay's Global Payments Highway enriches the dataset my models are trained on — improving accuracy and generating new insights. This is the data network effect: my models compound in value with every network expansion. My compensation should reflect this compounding data advantage."

**Lever 4: Cross-Border Payments DS Scarcity**
> "Data Scientists with real-time cross-border payments expertise — spanning multi-protocol, multi-currency, multi-regulatory datasets — are extraordinarily rare. Nium, Wise, and Remitly all recruit from this same micro-pool. I have competing interest and my specialized cross-border payments data science experience commands a premium."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €100,000 base and €90,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $175,000 base and $145,000 options for New York). I build the routing intelligence, fraud detection, and corridor optimization models for TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — working with the most comprehensive cross-border payments dataset in the world. My models power the MilX Creator Payout launch routing engine. I have competing interest from Wise at $310K TC and Nium at S$240K TC." Accept at €82,000+ base / $148,000+ base (NY) and no less than €62,000 / $100,000 in options.
