### Security Engineer — TerraPay Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes TerraPay's Global Payments Highway interoperability mandate, translating the Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout (MilX) launch into a security engineering compensation framework spanning Amsterdam, Singapore, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €80,000–€118,000 | €48,000–€110,000 | €128,000–€228,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$98,000–S$145,000 | S$58,000–S$130,000 | S$156,000–S$275,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $145,000–$200,000 | $75,000–$165,000 | $220,000–$365,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at TerraPay protect the Global Payments Highway — the real-time interoperability infrastructure through which money flows between wallets, banks, and mobile money operators across 130+ countries. The attack surface is extraordinarily broad: multi-protocol payment integrations, cross-border data flows subject to dozens of regulatory regimes, partner API connections with varying security postures, and real-time transaction flows where fraud must be detected in milliseconds. A security breach on the Global Payments Highway would not just affect TerraPay — it would impact the wallets, banks, and mobile money operators connected to it, creating cascading trust failures across the entire interoperability network. Security Engineers at TerraPay carry disproportionate responsibility relative to team size, and compensation must reflect the existential nature of the security mandate. As a private company, your options carry pre-IPO upside, and security engineers who protect critical financial infrastructure enable every dollar of revenue the company generates.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security Engineer | Security / Infra Engineer |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer | Security Lead |

TerraPay Security Engineer compensation should benchmark at or above Nium and significantly above Thunes and TransferGo, reflecting the broader attack surface of a multi-protocol interoperability network. The 7.5B+ account reach means a security incident has vastly larger blast radius than at competitors with smaller networks. Wise's security engineering compensation is a relevant upper benchmark.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) expands the security surface significantly. MilX introduces new partner integrations with creator economy platforms, each bringing unique security risks — new API connections, new data flows, new fraud vectors specific to creator payouts (payout splitting attacks, fake creator identity, payout velocity manipulation). Security Engineers must design and implement the security architecture for MilX before launch, ensuring that this new payout vertical does not introduce vulnerabilities to the existing Global Payments Highway.

The Botim partnership brings consumer-scale security challenges to TerraPay's infrastructure. Super-app payment flows introduce account takeover risks, social engineering vectors, and consumer fraud patterns that TerraPay's B2B2C security posture must evolve to address. Security Engineers must harden TerraPay's infrastructure against consumer-facing threats while maintaining the flexibility required for seamless Botim integration.

Security Engineers on the Global Payments Highway protect a network where the network effect applies to risk as well as value. Every new corridor added to the network adds new threat vectors, new regulatory requirements, and new partner security dependencies. But a secure, trusted highway becomes exponentially more valuable — trust is the fundamental enabler of interoperability. Security Engineers who build and maintain that trust are the foundation of TerraPay's network-effect value proposition.

"As a Security Engineer protecting TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I secure the real-time interoperability infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries. I'm designing the security architecture for the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch and hardening infrastructure for Botim consumer-scale threats. Trust is the foundation of interoperability — my security work is what makes the Global Payments Highway trustworthy. I want options reflecting my role as the guardian of TerraPay's most valuable asset: network trust."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Guardian of Network Trust**
> "I protect the Global Payments Highway — the interoperability infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts across wallets, banks, and mobile money in 130+ countries. A security breach on this network would cascade across every connected institution. Trust is the foundation of interoperability, and my security work is what makes the highway trustworthy. This existential security responsibility commands premium compensation."

**Lever 2: MilX Security Architecture**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch introduces new partner integrations, new API connections, and new fraud vectors specific to creator payouts. I'm designing the security architecture that protects this new vertical without introducing vulnerabilities to the existing Global Payments Highway. MilX cannot launch without my security clearance."

**Lever 3: Multi-Protocol, Multi-Jurisdiction Security Complexity**
> "Securing multi-protocol payment infrastructure — wallets, banks, and mobile money — across dozens of regulatory jurisdictions creates a security surface that dwarfs single-protocol payments companies. I navigate PSD2, MAS regulations, FinCEN requirements, and dozens of other regulatory security mandates simultaneously. This multi-jurisdiction security expertise is extremely scarce."

**Lever 4: Financial Infrastructure Security Talent War**
> "Security engineers with real-time financial infrastructure experience across multiple payment protocols and regulatory jurisdictions are among the scarcest talent in fintech and cybersecurity. Every major payments company is competing for this talent. I have competing interest from payments companies and my compensation should reflect both market scarcity and the existential security stakes."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €110,000 base and €100,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $188,000 base and $155,000 options for New York). I protect the Global Payments Highway — securing the interoperability infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts. I'm designing the security architecture for the MilX Creator Payout launch and hardening defenses for Botim consumer-scale threats. A security incident on this network would cascade across connected institutions globally. I have competing interest from Wise at $335K TC and Nium at S$260K TC." Accept at €88,000+ base / $158,000+ base (NY) and no less than €68,000 / $110,000 in options.
