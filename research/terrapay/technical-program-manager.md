### Technical Program Manager — TerraPay Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes TerraPay's Global Payments Highway interoperability mandate, translating the Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout (MilX) launch into a technical program management compensation framework spanning Amsterdam, Singapore, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €85,000–€120,000 | €50,000–€115,000 | €135,000–€235,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$105,000–S$150,000 | S$60,000–S$135,000 | S$165,000–S$285,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $145,000–$200,000 | $80,000–$175,000 | $225,000–$375,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at TerraPay coordinate the most complex cross-functional initiatives on the Global Payments Highway — managing programs that span engineering, product, compliance, partnerships, and operations across 130+ countries. You are the person who ensures that new payment corridors launch on time, partner integrations complete without disruption, and platform-wide initiatives like MilX land successfully. At TerraPay, technical program management is uniquely challenging because every program involves multiple payment protocols (wallets, banks, mobile money), multiple regulatory jurisdictions, and multiple external partner dependencies. You navigate the intersection of technical complexity, regulatory constraints, and global partner coordination. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with pre-IPO upside, and TPMs who deliver the programs that expand the network directly drive the valuation trajectory.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| TPM | Program Manager | TPM | Project Manager |
| Senior TPM | Senior PM / Director | Senior TPM | Head of Programs |

TerraPay TPM compensation should benchmark above Thunes and TransferGo, reflecting the multi-protocol, multi-jurisdictional complexity of managing programs on the Global Payments Highway. Nium's TPM roles in Singapore are the closest comparison but TerraPay's broader interoperability scope creates more complex program management challenges. Wise and Remitly TPM compensation provides relevant upper benchmarks for global payments program management.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) is the defining TPM program at TerraPay. MilX requires coordinating across engineering (payout orchestration engine development), product (creator platform partner prioritization), compliance (payout regulatory requirements across jurisdictions), partnerships (creator platform onboarding), and operations (payout settlement and support). The TPM who delivers MilX on schedule is driving the program that will define TerraPay's next growth phase. This is a career-defining program management opportunity.

The Botim partnership requires TPM coordination of a complex multi-party integration program — managing workstreams across TerraPay engineering, Botim product teams, regulatory compliance, and settlement operations. The TPM ensures that technical integration, compliance approvals, and operational readiness all converge on schedule. This is the kind of multi-organization, multi-jurisdiction program management that only experienced TPMs can drive.

TPMs on the Global Payments Highway manage the programs that grow the interoperability network. Every corridor launch, every partner integration, every platform initiative you deliver expands the network — and the network effect means each expansion multiplies the value of all existing connections. Your program execution velocity directly determines how fast the network effect compounds.

"As a Technical Program Manager driving programs on TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I'm leading the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch — coordinating engineering, product, compliance, partnerships, and operations across multiple jurisdictions. I also manage the Botim super-app integration program. My program execution velocity directly determines how fast the interoperability network grows across 7.5B+ accounts. I want TPM-level options reflecting my direct impact on network expansion."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Network Expansion Program Executor**
> "I manage the programs that directly expand TerraPay's interoperability network — corridor launches, partner integrations, and platform initiatives across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries. My program execution velocity determines how fast the network effect compounds. Every program I deliver on time accelerates TerraPay's growth trajectory."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Program Leadership**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch is the most complex cross-functional program at TerraPay — spanning engineering, product, compliance, partnerships, and operations across multiple jurisdictions. I'm the TPM coordinating all workstreams to deliver MilX on schedule. This is a career-defining program that will drive TerraPay's next growth phase."

**Lever 3: Multi-Jurisdiction Program Complexity**
> "Every program I manage at TerraPay spans multiple payment protocols, regulatory jurisdictions, and external partner dependencies simultaneously. This multi-protocol, multi-jurisdiction complexity exceeds what TPMs face at single-market or single-protocol payments companies. My program management expertise across this complexity spectrum commands premium compensation."

**Lever 4: Payments TPM Talent Scarcity**
> "TPMs who can manage multi-party, multi-jurisdiction, multi-protocol payment infrastructure programs are among the rarest talent in fintech. I have competing interest from payments companies and fintech infrastructure firms. My specialized cross-border payments program management experience justifies premium compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €112,000 base and €105,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $190,000 base and $162,000 options for New York). I lead the programs that expand TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — including the MilX Creator Payout launch and the Botim super-app integration. My program execution directly drives network-effect growth across 7.5B+ accounts. I have competing interest from Nium at S$270K TC and Wise at $345K TC." Accept at €92,000+ base / $158,000+ base (NY) and no less than €72,000 / $115,000 in options.
