#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €80,000–€115,000 | €55,000–€120,000 | €135,000–€235,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$100,000–S$145,000 | S$65,000–S$140,000 | S$165,000–S$285,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $140,000–$195,000 | $80,000–$180,000 | $220,000–$375,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at TerraPay define what gets built on the Global Payments Highway — determining which corridors to open, which payment methods to integrate, which partner APIs to prioritize, and how to sequence the interoperability roadmap across 130+ countries. This is not consumer product management; this is infrastructure product management at global scale, where every product decision impacts the real-time flow of money for billions of people. You balance technical feasibility, regulatory constraints, partner requirements, and market opportunity across dozens of jurisdictions simultaneously. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with pre-IPO upside, and PMs who define the product strategy for infrastructure-layer companies historically have outsized impact on valuation trajectory. Your compensation should reflect that you are the strategic decision-maker for the most ambitious interoperability platform in global payments.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| PM (Mid) | Product Manager | Product Manager | Product Manager |
| Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM | Senior PM / Head of Product |

TerraPay PM compensation should benchmark above Thunes and TransferGo due to the broader interoperability scope (wallets + banks + mobile money vs. narrower product surfaces). Nium offers competitive PM salaries in Singapore but TerraPay's multi-protocol mandate creates a more complex product management challenge. The comparison to Wise PMs is relevant — similar global scope but TerraPay's infrastructure-layer focus means PMs have more architectural product influence.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) is a PM-driven initiative at its core. Product Managers define the MilX product strategy — determining which creator platforms to partner with first, which payout corridors to prioritize, how to price creator payouts competitively, and how to design the payout experience to maximize adoption. MilX represents TerraPay's expansion from pure infrastructure into a more product-driven offering, and PMs are the strategists who shape this evolution.

The Botim partnership requires PM leadership in defining the integration product — what payment flows to support, how to design the API contract between Botim and TerraPay, how to optimize the user experience for super-app payments routed through TerraPay's infrastructure. This is complex B2B2C product management where the PM must balance partner needs, end-user experience, and infrastructure capabilities.

PMs on the Global Payments Highway own the product strategy for real-time interoperability. Every corridor prioritization decision, every payment method integration choice, every partner API design decision either accelerates or decelerates the network effect. The network effect premium for PMs is direct: the product decisions you make determine how fast the network grows and how valuable each node becomes. This is the most strategically impactful PM role in cross-border payments.

"As a Product Manager defining TerraPay's Global Payments Highway product strategy, I led the product vision for the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch and shaped the Botim super-app integration roadmap. My corridor prioritization and partner integration decisions directly drive the network effect across 7.5B+ accounts. I want PM-level options reflecting my strategic impact on the most valuable interoperability platform in global payments."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Interoperability Product Strategy Owner**
> "I define what gets built on the Global Payments Highway — which corridors to open, which payment methods to integrate, which partners to prioritize. Every product decision I make accelerates or decelerates the network effect across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries. This is infrastructure product strategy at planetary scale."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Product Vision**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch is a PM-driven initiative. I define the product strategy — partner prioritization, corridor sequencing, pricing model, payout experience design. MilX represents TerraPay's evolution from pure infrastructure to product-driven offering, and I'm the PM shaping that strategic transformation."

**Lever 3: Multi-Jurisdiction Product Complexity**
> "Product management at TerraPay spans dozens of regulatory jurisdictions, multiple payment protocols, and complex partner ecosystems simultaneously. Every product decision must navigate regulatory constraints, technical feasibility, and market opportunity across multiple countries. This multi-jurisdiction PM complexity exceeds anything at Thunes, Nium, or single-market payments companies."

**Lever 4: B2B2C Infrastructure PM Scarcity**
> "PMs who can manage B2B2C infrastructure products in cross-border payments are extremely rare. The combination of technical infrastructure understanding, regulatory knowledge, partner management, and global market strategy is a skill set that takes years to develop. I have interest from Nium and Wise, and my compensation should reflect this market scarcity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €108,000 base and €110,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $185,000 base and $168,000 options for New York). I define the product strategy for TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — the interoperability platform connecting 7.5B+ accounts. I led the product vision for the MilX Creator Payout launch and shaped the Botim integration roadmap. My corridor prioritization decisions directly drive network-effect growth. I have competing interest from Nium at S$265K TC and Wise at $345K TC." Accept at €88,000+ base / $155,000+ base (NY) and no less than €75,000 / $120,000 in options.
