#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €85,000–€115,000 | €60,000–€130,000 | €145,000–€245,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$105,000–S$145,000 | S$70,000–S$150,000 | S$175,000–S$295,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $155,000–$198,000 | $100,000–$200,000 | $255,000–$398,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at TerraPay are the technical backbone of the Global Payments Highway — owning critical subsystems that enable real-time cross-border interoperability at scale. You design and build the APIs, routing engines, and settlement systems that connect wallets, banks, and mobile money operators across 130+ countries. At the senior level, you are making architectural decisions that determine whether a payment from a Kenyan mobile wallet to a Brazilian bank account completes in seconds or fails entirely. TerraPay's network now reaches 7.5B+ accounts, and every technical decision you make either strengthens or weakens this interoperability fabric. As a private company, TerraPay offers options with substantial pre-IPO upside — senior engineers who build core infrastructure before a public listing historically capture the most significant wealth creation from their equity grants. Your compensation should reflect both the complexity of real-time cross-border payments engineering and the strategic value of the infrastructure you own.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Senior SWE (L4) | Senior Software Engineer | Senior SDE | Senior Developer |
| Senior SWE (L4+) | Staff Software Engineer | Staff SDE | Lead Developer |

TerraPay Senior SWE compensation tracks slightly above Thunes at the base salary level but with stronger options packages reflecting TerraPay's broader network reach (7.5B+ accounts vs. Thunes' more limited corridor coverage). Nium offers competitive base salary in Singapore but TerraPay's interoperability mandate creates broader technical scope and therefore justifies premium positioning. At the senior level, the comparison to larger payments companies like Wise or Remitly becomes relevant — TerraPay's infrastructure-layer focus means senior engineers have more architectural ownership than equivalent roles at application-layer companies.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) is a senior engineer's defining moment at TerraPay. MilX requires building a new payout orchestration layer that handles creator economy payments at global scale — routing payouts from platforms to creators across every payment method TerraPay supports, from bank transfers in the EU to mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa to wallet payouts in Southeast Asia. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will likely own the design and implementation of critical MilX subsystems.

The Botim partnership demands senior-level technical leadership. Integrating a super-app's payment flows into TerraPay's infrastructure requires building high-throughput APIs, managing real-time currency conversion, and ensuring regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. This is the kind of complex, multi-system integration work that only senior engineers can drive.

TerraPay's Global Payments Highway positioning means that Senior Software Engineers are not just building a payments product — they are building the interoperability standard for global digital payments. Every new payment corridor added to the network increases the value of every existing corridor (network effect), and senior engineers who architect these systems are creating infrastructure with compounding returns. This is analogous to being a senior engineer at AWS in 2010 — building the infrastructure layer that the rest of the industry will depend on.

"As a Senior Software Engineer architecting TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I own critical subsystems powering the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch and the Botim super-app integration. I'm designing the interoperability architecture that connects 7.5B+ accounts — my work creates compounding network value across 130+ countries. I want senior-level options that capture the pre-IPO upside of this infrastructure."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Interoperability Architecture Ownership**
> "I own the architecture of critical Global Payments Highway subsystems — the routing engines, settlement systems, and interoperability APIs that connect wallets, banks, and mobile money across 130+ countries. This is infrastructure-layer ownership with compounding network effects. My architectural decisions determine whether real-time cross-border payments work at 7.5B-account scale."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Technical Leadership**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch requires a new payout orchestration layer spanning every payment method TerraPay supports. As a Senior Engineer, I design and build the critical subsystems enabling global creator economy payouts — this is the product initiative that will define TerraPay's next growth phase."

**Lever 3: Botim Integration Complexity Premium**
> "The Botim super-app partnership demands senior-level technical leadership for a complex multi-system integration — high-throughput APIs, real-time FX, multi-jurisdictional compliance. This integration brings consumer-scale traffic to B2B2C infrastructure. I'm the engineer who makes this work reliably at scale."

**Lever 4: Pre-IPO Infrastructure Builder Premium**
> "TerraPay is private with a trajectory toward a multi-billion dollar outcome. Senior engineers who build core infrastructure before a public listing historically capture the most significant wealth from equity grants. My options should reflect that I'm building the Global Payments Highway — the infrastructure the industry will depend on — not incremental features on an existing platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €108,000 base and €120,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $190,000 base and $185,000 options for New York). I architect critical interoperability subsystems on TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — the routing and settlement infrastructure connecting 7.5B+ accounts and powering the MilX Creator Payout launch. I have competing offers from Nium at S$280K TC and Thunes at comparable levels. Senior engineers building network-effect interoperability infrastructure at global scale are exceptionally scarce." Accept at €92,000+ base / $165,000+ base (NY) and no less than €85,000 / $140,000 in options.
