#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €72,000–€105,000 | €42,000–€95,000 | €114,000–€200,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$88,000–S$130,000 | S$52,000–S$115,000 | S$140,000–S$245,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $130,000–$182,000 | $68,000–$148,000 | $198,000–$330,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at TerraPay build and maintain the data infrastructure that captures, processes, and delivers insights from one of the most unique datasets in global finance — real-time cross-border payment flows across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries, spanning wallets, banks, and mobile money operators. You build the data pipelines, streaming infrastructure, data warehouses, and analytics platforms that transform raw transaction data into the intelligence that drives corridor optimization, fraud detection, regulatory reporting, and partner analytics. At TerraPay, data engineering is foundational infrastructure — without reliable, real-time data pipelines, the Global Payments Highway cannot optimize routing, detect fraud, or meet regulatory reporting obligations across dozens of jurisdictions. As a private company, your options carry pre-IPO upside, and data engineers who build the analytics foundation for infrastructure-layer companies create compounding value.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data Engineer | Data / BI Engineer |
| Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer / Lead |

TerraPay Data Engineer compensation should benchmark at or above Thunes and TransferGo, reflecting the data complexity of multi-protocol interoperability infrastructure. Nium's data engineering roles in Singapore are the closest comparison. The key differentiator: TerraPay's data includes mobile money transaction patterns alongside bank and wallet data, creating a uniquely diverse and complex data engineering challenge that commands premium positioning.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) creates substantial new data engineering requirements. MilX introduces a new class of high-frequency, globally distributed payout transactions that require new data pipelines — ingesting creator payout events from partner platforms, tracking payout status across corridors, generating payout analytics for creator platforms, and building the data infrastructure for MilX-specific regulatory reporting. Data Engineers must build this new data pipeline infrastructure in parallel with maintaining existing Global Payments Highway data systems.

The Botim partnership generates consumer-scale data volumes flowing through TerraPay's data infrastructure for the first time. Data Engineers must scale data pipelines to handle super-app transaction volumes — orders of magnitude higher frequency than existing B2B2C flows — while maintaining data quality, freshness, and compliance across jurisdictions. This is a step-change in data infrastructure requirements.

Data Engineers on the Global Payments Highway build the data fabric that connects all layers of the interoperability network. Every new corridor added to the network generates new data streams, enriches existing datasets, and creates new analytics possibilities — this is the data network effect. The data infrastructure you build becomes more valuable with every network expansion, creating a compounding data asset that powers routing optimization, fraud detection, and business intelligence.

"As a Data Engineer building the data infrastructure for TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I build the pipelines processing real-time cross-border payment data across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries. I'm building new data pipeline infrastructure for the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch and scaling for Botim consumer-scale data volumes. My data infrastructure powers the analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory reporting that the entire platform depends on. I want options reflecting my foundational data infrastructure contribution."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Global Payments Data Infrastructure Builder**
> "I build the data pipelines and analytics infrastructure processing real-time cross-border payment data across 7.5B+ accounts in 130+ countries — wallets, banks, and mobile money. Without my data infrastructure, TerraPay cannot optimize routing, detect fraud, or meet regulatory reporting obligations. This foundational infrastructure role commands premium compensation."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Data Pipelines**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch requires building entirely new data pipeline infrastructure — ingesting creator payout events, tracking payout status across corridors, generating partner analytics, and building MilX-specific regulatory reporting. I'm building this new data infrastructure from scratch while maintaining existing Global Payments Highway data systems."

**Lever 3: Consumer-Scale Data Infrastructure Scaling**
> "The Botim super-app partnership is scaling TerraPay's data infrastructure to consumer-level transaction volumes — orders of magnitude higher than existing B2B2C data flows. I'm building the streaming infrastructure, data lake architecture, and real-time analytics pipelines that handle this step-change in data volume while maintaining quality and compliance."

**Lever 4: Cross-Border Payments Data Engineering Scarcity**
> "Data engineers with experience building real-time, multi-protocol, multi-currency, multi-regulatory payment data infrastructure are extremely scarce. Nium, Wise, Remitly, and Thunes all compete for this same micro-pool of talent. I have competing interest and my specialized cross-border payments data engineering experience commands a premium."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €98,000 base and €88,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $170,000 base and $138,000 options for New York). I build the data pipeline infrastructure processing real-time cross-border payment data across TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — powering analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory reporting for 7.5B+ accounts. I'm building new MilX Creator Payout data pipelines and scaling for Botim consumer-scale volumes. I have competing interest from Nium at S$230K TC and Wise at $305K TC." Accept at €80,000+ base / $142,000+ base (NY) and no less than €58,000 / $95,000 in options.
