#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €65,000–€95,000 | €35,000–€80,000 | €100,000–€175,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$78,000–S$115,000 | S$40,000–S$95,000 | S$118,000–S$210,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at TerraPay shape the interfaces and experiences through which partners, developers, and end-users interact with the Global Payments Highway. This is infrastructure design — designing developer portals, partner dashboards, API documentation experiences, transaction monitoring interfaces, and compliance workflows that must work across 130+ countries with different languages, currencies, and regulatory requirements. Unlike consumer fintech design where you optimize a single checkout flow, TerraPay design requires creating coherent experiences across extraordinarily complex multi-party, multi-currency, multi-regulatory payment flows. As a private company, your options carry pre-IPO upside, and designers who shape the interface layer of infrastructure platforms create lasting value by making complex systems accessible and adoptable.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Product Designer | UX Designer | Product Designer | Product Designer |
| Senior Product Designer | Senior Designer | Senior Product Designer | Senior Designer / Design Lead |

TerraPay Product Designer compensation should benchmark near Nium and above TransferGo, reflecting the complexity of designing for multi-protocol interoperability infrastructure. Thunes design roles are the closest comparison in scope but TerraPay's larger network (7.5B+ accounts) creates more complex design challenges. Wise offers competitive design salaries and is a relevant benchmark for global payments design at scale.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) creates significant design work for Product Designers. MilX requires designing the creator payout experience — the interfaces through which creator platforms integrate TerraPay payouts, the dashboards where creators monitor their earnings and payout status, and the onboarding flows that bring new creator-platform partners onto the Global Payments Highway. This is a new product surface that must feel simple despite the extraordinary complexity of routing payouts across dozens of payment methods and currencies globally.

The Botim partnership requires designing the integration experience between a consumer-facing super-app and TerraPay's infrastructure. Product Designers must ensure that payments routed through TerraPay within the Botim app feel native and seamless, while also designing the partner-facing integration tools that make the Botim integration replicable for future super-app partnerships.

Designers on the Global Payments Highway are making the world's most complex payment interoperability infrastructure usable. Every design decision that simplifies partner onboarding, clarifies transaction status, or streamlines compliance workflows accelerates network adoption — and the network effect means faster adoption compounds the value of the entire platform. Good design is a direct driver of interoperability network growth.

"As a Product Designer shaping the Global Payments Highway experience at TerraPay, I designed the creator payout interfaces for the Jan 28 MilX launch and the Botim super-app integration experience. My design work makes interoperability infrastructure across 7.5B+ accounts usable and adoptable — directly accelerating network-effect growth. I want design-level options reflecting my impact on platform adoption."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Infrastructure Usability Architect**
> "I design the interfaces that make TerraPay's Global Payments Highway usable — partner dashboards, developer portals, transaction monitoring, and compliance workflows across 130+ countries. My design work directly determines how fast partners can onboard and how effectively they use the interoperability infrastructure. Usability drives adoption, and adoption drives network-effect value."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Experience Design**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 MilX Creator Payout launch requires designing an entirely new product surface — creator platform integration flows, payout dashboards, and onboarding experiences. I'm designing simplicity on top of extraordinary complexity — routing payouts across dozens of payment methods and currencies while making the experience feel effortless."

**Lever 3: Multi-Protocol Design Complexity**
> "Designing for TerraPay's multi-protocol infrastructure — wallets, banks, and mobile money — requires creating coherent experiences across fundamentally different payment paradigms. This design complexity exceeds anything at single-protocol payments companies. My multi-protocol design expertise commands a premium in this market."

**Lever 4: Payments Infrastructure Design Scarcity**
> "Product Designers with B2B payments infrastructure experience are rare. Designing for complex multi-party, multi-currency, multi-regulatory payment flows requires deep domain expertise that most consumer-focused designers lack. I have competing interest from fintech companies, and my specialized payments design experience justifies premium compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €88,000 base and €72,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $158,000 base and $120,000 options for New York). I design the partner and developer experiences for TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — making interoperability infrastructure across 7.5B+ accounts usable at global scale. I designed the MilX Creator Payout experience and the Botim integration flows. I have competing interest from Nium at S$195K TC and Wise at $270K TC." Accept at €72,000+ base / $130,000+ base (NY) and no less than €48,000 / $80,000 in options.
