### Software Engineer — TerraPay Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: This guide decodes TerraPay's Global Payments Highway interoperability mandate, translating the Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout (MilX) launch into a software engineering compensation framework spanning Amsterdam, Singapore, and New York markets.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2025-2026)

| Region | Base Salary | Options (4yr) | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 🇳🇱 Amsterdam (EUR) | €65,000–€88,000 | €40,000–€80,000 | €105,000–€168,000 |
| 🇸🇬 Singapore (SGD) | S$72,000–S$105,000 | S$45,000–S$90,000 | S$117,000–S$195,000 |
| 🇺🇸 New York (USD) | $110,000–$148,000 | $60,000–$120,000 | $170,000–$268,000 |

**Negotiation DNA**

TerraPay Software Engineers build the core infrastructure of the Global Payments Highway — the real-time interoperability network connecting 7.5 billion+ accounts across 130+ countries. Unlike traditional payments companies where engineers work on siloed domestic systems, every line of code you write at TerraPay extends a network that bridges wallets, banks, and mobile money operators in real time. As a private company pre-IPO, your options carry significant upside potential as TerraPay scales its cross-border payments infrastructure. The company's unique position as a licensed payments infrastructure provider — not a consumer app — means your engineering work directly enables the interoperability layer that the entire digital payments ecosystem depends upon. Software Engineers at TerraPay are building the financial plumbing of the global economy, and compensation should reflect this infrastructure-critical mandate.

#### Level Mapping & Internal Benchmarking

| TerraPay Level | Equivalent at Thunes | Equivalent at Nium | Equivalent at TransferGo |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| SWE I (Junior) | Software Engineer I | SDE I | Junior Developer |
| SWE II (Mid) | Software Engineer II | SDE II | Software Developer |

TerraPay's SWE compensation sits between Thunes (comparable infra-layer payments company) and Nium (better-funded but similar cross-border focus). TransferGo offers lower base but TerraPay's options upside and global highway positioning create superior total comp over a 4-year horizon. Key differentiator: TerraPay is the only pure-play interoperability infrastructure company at this scale, making direct comparisons difficult and giving candidates leverage to argue for premium positioning.

#### 🛣️ TerraPay Interoperability & Global Payments Highway Lever

The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout launch (MilX) represents a transformational moment for TerraPay Software Engineers. MilX enables creator economy payments globally — allowing content creators, gig workers, and digital entrepreneurs to receive payouts instantly across borders through TerraPay's infrastructure. This is not a minor product extension; it opens an entirely new payments vertical that will drive massive transaction volume growth.

The Botim partnership integrates super-app payments into TerraPay's infrastructure, creating a direct consumer touchpoint for what has historically been a B2B2C platform. For Software Engineers, this means building APIs and services that must handle super-app scale traffic patterns — millions of concurrent users expecting sub-second payment completion.

As a Software Engineer on the Global Payments Highway, you are an architect of real-time interoperability connecting wallets, banks, and mobile money across 130+ countries. Every new corridor TerraPay adds increases the value of the network exponentially — this is the classic network effect premium. When you build a feature that enables a new payment route between, say, Nigerian mobile money and Indonesian e-wallets, you are not just connecting two endpoints; you are multiplying the value of every existing connection on the network.

"As a Software Engineer building TerraPay's Global Payments Highway, I'm constructing the interoperability layer that powers the Jan 28 MilX Creator Payout launch and the Botim super-app integration. My code connects 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries — every new corridor I build increases network value exponentially. I want options reflecting this infrastructure's pre-IPO growth trajectory."

#### Global Levers

**Lever 1: Network Effect Infrastructure Builder**
> "I build the core infrastructure of the Global Payments Highway — the real-time interoperability network connecting 7.5B+ accounts across 130+ countries. Every API endpoint I ship, every new corridor I enable, increases the value of the entire network exponentially. This network effect infrastructure is the most valuable asset in cross-border payments."

**Lever 2: MilX Creator Payout Launch Impact**
> "The Jan 28, 2026 Creator Payout (MilX) launch opens an entirely new payments vertical for TerraPay. As an engineer building the infrastructure enabling global creator economy payouts, I'm directly driving the transaction volume growth that will define TerraPay's next funding round and potential IPO trajectory."

**Lever 3: Scarce Cross-Border Payments Talent**
> "Engineers with real-time cross-border payments infrastructure experience are exceptionally scarce. Thunes, Nium, and TransferGo are all competing for the same talent pool. My ability to build interoperability systems across diverse payment networks — wallets, banks, mobile money — commands premium comp in this talent-constrained market."

**Lever 4: Pre-IPO Options Upside**
> "TerraPay is private with significant growth ahead. My options should reflect not just current valuation but the trajectory implied by the MilX launch, Botim partnership, and expansion to 130+ countries. I want an options package that fairly values my contribution to infrastructure that could support a multi-billion dollar public valuation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: "I'm targeting €82,000 base and €75,000 in options over 4 years for the Amsterdam role (or $142,000 base and $115,000 options for New York). I build the real-time interoperability infrastructure powering TerraPay's Global Payments Highway — connecting 7.5B+ accounts and enabling the MilX Creator Payout launch. I have competing offers from Thunes and Nium at comparable total comp. Engineers building network-effect payments infrastructure at this scale are defining the future of cross-border finance." Accept at €72,000+ base / $125,000+ base (NY) and no less than €55,000 / $85,000 in options.
