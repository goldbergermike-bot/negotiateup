### Software Engineer | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Xfinity + Peacock + NBCUniversal | Strong Tech Investment

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $130K–$185K | $40K–$130K | 10-15% | $160K–$260K |
| Denver / Seattle | $125K–$180K | $35K–$120K | 10-15% | $150K–$245K |
| London (UK) | £95K–£135K | £25K–£90K | 10-15% | $120K–$195K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Comcast build technology that powers one of the largest media and telecommunications companies in the world. With a $170B market cap headquartered in Philadelphia, Comcast operates across multiple high-impact domains: Xfinity broadband and cable (serving 30M+ customers), Peacock streaming (35M+ paid subscribers), NBCUniversal entertainment, and Sky (European media). Comcast has invested heavily in its technology transformation, moving from a legacy cable operator to a modern tech-enabled media company. SWEs here work on everything from Xfinity platform services and smart home technology to Peacock's streaming infrastructure and NBCUniversal's content delivery systems.

Comcast's compensation philosophy has shifted significantly in recent years to compete for engineering talent against Big Tech and streaming companies. Base salaries of $130K-$185K are competitive with traditional enterprise tech, and RSU grants have expanded as Comcast positions itself as a technology employer. The bonus structure of 10-15% adds meaningful upside, and the company offers strong benefits including free Xfinity services, tuition reimbursement, and comprehensive health coverage.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast SWE (T3-T4) = Google L3-L4 = Meta E3-E4 = Amazon SDE I-II = Microsoft 59-62 = Apple ICT2-ICT3

**Comcast Technology Investment Premium**

Comcast's technology spend exceeds $5B annually, placing it among the top technology investors outside of pure tech companies. The company has built world-class engineering centers in Philadelphia, Denver, and Silicon Valley, and has recruited senior engineering leadership from Google, Amazon, and Netflix. Comcast's X1 platform, Xfinity app ecosystem, and Peacock streaming infrastructure represent genuine engineering achievements at consumer scale. Engineers who join Comcast benefit from working on problems that span telecommunications, media, entertainment, and consumer technology — a breadth of technical challenges that few companies can match.

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Platform Scale Impact:** "I'll be building technology that serves 30M+ Xfinity customers and 35M+ Peacock subscribers — that's consumer-scale engineering across multiple platforms. My code impacts revenue streams spanning broadband, streaming, and entertainment. I'd like the base salary to reflect this scale at $[X]K."

2. **Tech Transformation Premium:** "Comcast's technology transformation from legacy cable to modern tech platform requires engineers who can bridge both worlds. My experience with [cloud architecture/microservices/streaming systems] directly supports this transformation, and I believe a higher RSU grant of $[Y]K over four years reflects the strategic value of this skill set."

3. **Competing Big Tech Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Microsoft] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm excited about Comcast's unique combination of media and technology challenges, I want to make sure the compensation is competitive. Can we discuss increasing the overall package by $[20-40]K?"

4. **Vertical Integration Breadth:** "Comcast's vertically integrated model means I'll work across content, distribution, and streaming — technical domains that are siloed at other companies. This cross-domain exposure is valuable, but so is the engineering complexity it demands. I'd like the offer to reflect the breadth and depth of the technical challenges at $[X]K total comp."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of $[X]K base, $[Y]K RSUs, and a [Z]% bonus. I'm genuinely excited about Comcast's technology platform and the engineering challenges across Xfinity, Peacock, and NBCUniversal. To align this with my market value, I'd like to discuss three adjustments: first, a base increase to $[X+10-15]K to match the top of Comcast's T[3/4] band; second, an RSU increase to $[Y+30-50]K to close the gap with my competing offer from [competitor] at $[TC]K; and third, a signing bonus of $[25-40]K to offset unvested equity at my current employer. At a total comp of $[220-260]K, I believe this reflects both the competitive market and the multi-platform impact of this role. I'm ready to sign if we can reach alignment."
