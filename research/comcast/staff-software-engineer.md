**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Comcast are the highest individual contributor technical authorities, setting architectural direction across entire product lines and business units. At a $170B company operating Xfinity (30M+ broadband customers), Peacock (35M+ streaming subscribers), and NBCUniversal, Staff SWEs define the technical strategy that underpins billions in revenue. This is a role where you architect systems that span telecommunications, streaming, and media — influencing engineering decisions that affect hundreds of engineers and tens of millions of end users.

Comcast has invested significantly in creating a competitive Staff-level track to retain top technical talent who might otherwise leave for Google, Meta, or Netflix. Total comp at $265K-$425K reflects the strategic importance of this role, with RSU grants up to $250K over four years representing Comcast's commitment to long-term retention of Staff-level engineers.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast Staff SWE (T6) = Google L6 = Meta E6 = Amazon Principal SDE = Microsoft 65-66 = Apple ICT5 = Netflix Senior+ SWE

**Comcast Technology Investment Premium**

Staff-level engineers at Comcast have an outsized strategic impact because the company's technology decisions affect multiple business lines simultaneously. A Staff SWE architecting Comcast's content delivery infrastructure, for example, impacts Peacock streaming quality, Xfinity video service, and NBCUniversal content distribution — all from a single architectural decision. This cross-business-unit influence is unique to Comcast's vertically integrated structure and creates leverage for Staff engineers who can think across domain boundaries.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Organization Technical Strategy:** "As a Staff SWE, I'll set architectural direction that spans Comcast's business units — Xfinity, Peacock, and NBCUniversal. This cross-organizational impact is equivalent to what Staff engineers do at Google or Meta, and the compensation should reflect that. I'm looking for a base of $[235-250]K and RSUs of $[200-250]K."

2. **Staff-Level Market Scarcity:** "Staff-level engineers represent the top 5-10% of the engineering workforce, and the market for this talent is extremely competitive. Google, Meta, and Netflix offer $500K-$700K+ total comp at this level. While Comcast's total comp philosophy differs, closing the gap with a stronger RSU grant demonstrates the company's commitment to building a world-class technical leadership bench."

3. **Revenue-Scale Architecture Ownership:** "The systems I'll architect directly support revenue streams totaling tens of billions of dollars across broadband, streaming, and entertainment. At this scale, the ROI on competitive Staff-level compensation is enormous — even marginal improvements in platform reliability or performance translate to millions in retained revenue."

4. **Technical Leadership Retention:** "Comcast's technology transformation requires stable, senior technical leadership. A compelling initial offer with a signing bonus of $[50-75]K and top-of-band RSUs signals that Comcast is serious about retaining Staff-level talent for the long term, rather than losing them to Big Tech after 18-24 months."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Staff SWE opportunity — defining Comcast's technical architecture across its media-tech portfolio is the kind of strategic impact I'm looking for. I currently hold a competing offer from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at the L6/E6/Principal level at $[550-650]K total comp. I understand Comcast's compensation structure differs, but I'd like to discuss a package that reflects the strategic nature of this role: $[240-250]K base, $[220-250]K RSUs over four years, and a $[60-75]K signing bonus. This brings first-year total comp to approximately $[380-425]K, which I believe fairly reflects Staff-level impact at a $170B company. I'm ready to commit to Comcast's technology transformation if we can align."
