### Technical Program Manager | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Cross-Organization Program Delivery | Complex Multi-Platform Initiatives

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

| Philadelphia / NYC | $140K–$200K | $45K–$145K | 12-18% | $175K–$295K |
| Denver / Seattle | $135K–$195K | $40K–$135K | 12-18% | $165K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Comcast orchestrate the delivery of complex technology programs across one of the most diverse media-tech portfolios in the world. When Comcast launches a new Peacock feature to 35M+ subscribers, rolls out a network upgrade across 30M+ Xfinity customers, or integrates a new capability across NBCUniversal's digital properties, a TPM is driving the program from inception to delivery. The role demands deep technical literacy combined with exceptional program management skills — coordinating across engineering teams, product organizations, business stakeholders, and often external partners.

Comcast's vertically integrated model creates programs of unusual complexity. A single initiative might span streaming engineering (Peacock), network operations (Xfinity), content systems (NBCUniversal), and data analytics — each with different technical stacks, organizational cultures, and delivery timelines. TPMs who can navigate this complexity and deliver results are highly valued and well-compensated.

**Comcast Program Complexity Premium**

Comcast's TPMs operate in an environment of unusual organizational and technical complexity. The company's multiple business units, legacy and modern technology stacks, regulatory requirements (FCC, content licensing), and massive consumer scale create program management challenges that exceed those at most pure-play technology companies. TPMs who can successfully deliver programs in this environment bring a rare combination of technical depth, organizational navigation, and stakeholder management skills.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Organization Program Scope:** "I'll drive programs that span Comcast's business units — coordinating engineering teams, product organizations, and business stakeholders across streaming, broadband, and media. This cross-organizational scope is equivalent to senior TPM roles at single-product companies, and I'd like compensation to reflect this at $[X]K total comp."

2. **Program Revenue Impact:** "The programs I deliver will directly impact Comcast's revenue and customer experience — launching features for 65M+ consumers, enabling new revenue streams, or driving operational efficiency. This direct business impact warrants a base of $[X]K and RSUs of $[Y]K."

3. **Technical Complexity Navigation:** "Comcast's hybrid technology environment — legacy systems, cloud-native platforms, telecommunications infrastructure, and streaming services — creates program delivery challenges that don't exist at pure tech companies. My experience navigating similar complexity at [company] is directly valuable and should be reflected in the offer."

4. **Competing TPM Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Microsoft] at $[X]K total comp for a TPM role. While I'm drawn to Comcast's unique program complexity, the compensation needs to be competitive with Big Tech alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. The TPM opportunity at Comcast is compelling — driving cross-organization technology programs across streaming, broadband, and media is the kind of high-impact delivery I excel at. To align with my market value: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[120-145]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-40]K. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[X]K total comp. At approximately $[255-295]K, I believe this reflects the program complexity and cross-organizational scope of this role at a $170B company. I'm ready to commit."
