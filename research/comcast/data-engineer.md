**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Comcast build and maintain the data infrastructure that supports one of the largest consumer data operations in the United States. With 30M+ Xfinity broadband customers, 35M+ Peacock streaming subscribers, and NBCUniversal's media operations, Comcast generates petabytes of data across viewership, network usage, advertising, and customer interaction. Data Engineers design the pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming systems that transform this raw data into the intelligence that drives product decisions, advertising targeting, content recommendations, and network optimization.

Comcast has invested heavily in modernizing its data infrastructure, migrating from legacy on-premise systems to cloud-native data platforms. This transformation creates high demand for Data Engineers with experience in both traditional and modern data architectures — Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, and cloud-native data services on AWS and GCP.

**Comcast Data Platform Premium**

Comcast's data assets are among the most valuable in media and telecommunications. The company's ability to combine broadband usage data, streaming viewership, advertising engagement, and customer service interactions creates a 360-degree view of the consumer that competitors in pure-play streaming or pure-play telecom cannot match. Data Engineers who build the platforms that unlock this cross-business intelligence are directly enabling Comcast's competitive advantage and advertising revenue growth.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Business Data Integration:** "Comcast's unique data advantage comes from integrating broadband, streaming, and media data into a unified platform. I bring experience building cross-domain data pipelines at [company], and this expertise directly supports Comcast's data strategy. I'd like a base of $[X]K to reflect this specialized skill set."

2. **Data Infrastructure Modernization:** "I understand Comcast is actively modernizing its data infrastructure from legacy systems to cloud-native platforms. My experience with [Spark/Kafka/Snowflake/cloud-native architectures] means I can accelerate this transformation. Engineers driving data modernization at scale command a premium — I'd like to discuss RSUs of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Advertising Data Revenue Impact:** "The data pipelines I build will directly power Comcast's advertising business across Peacock and NBCUniversal — a multi-billion-dollar revenue stream that depends on data quality and freshness. This direct revenue impact justifies top-of-band compensation."

4. **Competing Data Platform Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Google/Amazon] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm excited about Comcast's unique cross-business data challenges, I need the package to be competitive. Can we discuss closing the gap with additional RSUs and a signing bonus?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about Comcast's data engineering challenges — building a unified data platform across broadband, streaming, and media is a genuinely unique opportunity. To align with my market value, I'd like to discuss: a base increase to $[X+10-15]K, RSU grant of $[Y+30-50]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[20-35]K. My competing offer from [competitor] is at $[TC]K total comp, and I believe these adjustments bring the Comcast offer in line while reflecting the strategic importance of data infrastructure to Comcast's business. I'm ready to accept if we can align."
