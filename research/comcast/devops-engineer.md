### DevOps Engineer | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Infrastructure at Massive Scale | Platform Reliability Across Xfinity + Peacock

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $130K–$185K | $35K–$125K | 10-15% | $155K–$255K |
| Denver / Seattle | $125K–$180K | $30K–$115K | 10-15% | $145K–$240K |
| London (UK) | £95K–£135K | £22K–£85K | 10-15% | $115K–$190K |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Comcast are responsible for the infrastructure reliability and deployment pipelines that keep America's largest cable and broadband provider running 24/7. When Xfinity's broadband goes down for 30M+ customers or Peacock buffers during a Sunday Night Football stream, the business impact is measured in millions of dollars per hour. Comcast's infrastructure spans on-premise data centers, cloud environments (AWS, GCP), and a massive edge network — creating a hybrid infrastructure challenge that is among the most complex in the industry.

Comcast's technology transformation has elevated DevOps from an operational function to a strategic priority. The company is actively migrating workloads to the cloud, adopting Kubernetes at scale, implementing GitOps workflows, and building CI/CD pipelines that support thousands of engineers across multiple business units. DevOps Engineers who can accelerate this modernization while maintaining the reliability of legacy systems are in high demand.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast DevOps Engineer (T3-T5) = Google L3-L5 SRE = Amazon SDE II-III (Infrastructure) = Microsoft 60-63 = Meta E3-E5 Production Engineer

**Comcast Infrastructure Premium**

Comcast's infrastructure requirements are uniquely complex because the company operates both telecommunications network infrastructure (cable, broadband, fiber) and software platform infrastructure (Peacock streaming, Xfinity app, NBCUniversal content delivery). DevOps Engineers who can bridge these two worlds — ensuring reliability for physical network operations while driving cloud-native transformation for software platforms — bring a rare dual expertise that commands premium compensation.

**Global Levers**

1. **Hybrid Infrastructure Complexity:** "Comcast's infrastructure spans on-premise data centers, cloud environments, and edge networks — one of the most complex hybrid infrastructures in the industry. My experience managing [Kubernetes/Terraform/cloud migrations] at scale directly addresses this complexity. I'd like a base of $[X]K reflecting this specialized expertise."

2. **Reliability Revenue Impact:** "Downtime for Xfinity broadband or Peacock streaming costs millions per hour in lost revenue and customer churn. My track record of achieving [X]% uptime at [company] for [Y] users demonstrates that investing in my compensation is a fraction of the revenue I protect. I'd like RSUs of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Cloud Migration Acceleration:** "Comcast's cloud migration is a multi-billion-dollar strategic initiative. DevOps Engineers who can accelerate this migration while maintaining reliability are worth premium compensation. My experience leading cloud migrations at [company] positions me to drive this initiative forward — I'd like the offer to reflect this at $[X]K total comp."

4. **Competing Infrastructure Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft Azure] at $[X]K total comp for a similar infrastructure role. While Comcast's hybrid infrastructure challenge is more compelling, I need the compensation to be competitive with pure cloud providers."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. Comcast's infrastructure challenges — hybrid cloud, massive scale, and reliability requirements across broadband and streaming — are exactly the kind of problems I want to solve. To align with my market value: a base increase to $[X+10-15]K, RSU grant of $[Y+25-40]K, and a signing bonus of $[20-30]K. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[TC]K, and I believe these adjustments fairly reflect the complexity and business criticality of Comcast's infrastructure. I'm ready to commit if we can align."
