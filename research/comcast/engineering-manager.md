### Engineering Manager | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Multi-Team Technical Leadership | Business-Critical Platform Ownership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $165K–$230K | $70K–$200K | 15-20% | $225K–$370K |
| Denver / Seattle | $160K–$225K | $65K–$190K | 15-20% | $215K–$355K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Comcast lead teams building technology across a $170B media-tech conglomerate. Whether you're managing a team delivering Peacock streaming features, Xfinity platform services, or NBCUniversal content systems, your leadership directly impacts products used by tens of millions of consumers. Comcast EMs are expected to combine strong technical depth with people management excellence — hiring and retaining top talent, setting technical direction, and delivering against business objectives across complex, cross-functional programs.

The EM role at Comcast sits at a critical juncture in the company's technology transformation. Managers who can recruit Big Tech caliber engineers to Comcast, drive cloud migration initiatives, and deliver modern platform capabilities while managing legacy technical debt are exceptionally valuable. Comcast has raised EM compensation significantly in recent years to attract managers from Google, Amazon, and Meta who can elevate engineering culture and execution quality.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast EM (M1-M2) = Google L5-L6 Manager = Meta E5-E6 Manager = Amazon L6-L7 Manager = Microsoft 63-65 Manager

**Comcast Leadership Premium**

Comcast's technology organization employs thousands of engineers across multiple business units, and Engineering Managers are the linchpin connecting corporate strategy to technical execution. EMs at Comcast have unusually broad scope because the company's vertically integrated model means engineering teams often work across business boundaries — a Peacock EM might coordinate with Xfinity teams for content delivery optimization, or an Xfinity platform EM might integrate with NBCUniversal for video-on-demand services.

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Business-Unit Scope:** "As an EM at Comcast, I'll lead teams whose work spans multiple business units — broadband, streaming, and media. This cross-business scope is equivalent to managing at a Director level at single-product companies. I'd like the base and RSU to reflect this broader impact at $[X]K base and $[Y]K RSUs."

2. **Talent Recruitment and Retention:** "A key part of my role is recruiting and retaining top engineering talent in a competitive market. My track record of building high-performing teams at [company] — including hiring from [Big Tech companies] — directly contributes to Comcast's technology transformation. Investing in competitive EM compensation ensures I can credibly recruit top talent to my team."

3. **Technology Transformation Driver:** "Comcast's ongoing technology transformation — cloud migration, platform modernization, and engineering culture evolution — requires managers who have led similar transformations at scale. My experience driving [specific transformation] at [company] positions me to accelerate Comcast's transformation, and the compensation should reflect this strategic impact."

4. **Competing Management Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Meta] at the [L6/L7] management level with total comp of $[X]K. While I'm drawn to Comcast's unique challenges and the opportunity to lead engineering across media-tech, the offer needs to approach competitive parity. Can we discuss increasing the package to $[X]K total comp?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Engineering Manager opportunity at Comcast — leading teams across the company's media-tech platform is the kind of high-impact leadership role I'm looking for. To make this work, I'd like to discuss: a base of $[215-230]K, RSU grant of $[170-200]K over four years, a 20% bonus target, and a signing bonus of $[40-60]K. This brings first-year total comp to approximately $[325-370]K, which reflects both the competitive EM market and the multi-business-unit scope of this role. My competing offer from [competitor] is at $[X]K, and I'd prefer to choose Comcast. Let's find the right package."
