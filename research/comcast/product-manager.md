**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Comcast own the strategy and roadmap for products that touch 65M+ consumers. Whether you're driving Peacock's subscriber growth strategy, defining Xfinity's next-generation broadband experience, or building NBCUniversal's digital content platform, you sit at the intersection of technology, business, and user experience at a $170B company. Comcast PMs operate with unusually broad scope because the company's vertically integrated model means product decisions ripple across content, distribution, and streaming simultaneously.

Comcast has elevated the PM function significantly, hiring product leaders from Google, Amazon, and Netflix to bring Big Tech product discipline to the media-tech space. PMs here have meaningful P&L ownership and direct access to senior leadership, making it a compelling role for product leaders who want to shape the future of media and telecommunications.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast PM (P3-P5) = Google L4-L6 PM = Meta E4-E6 PM = Amazon PM L5-L7 = Microsoft 62-65 PM

**Comcast Product Strategy Premium**

Comcast PMs have a unique advantage: they can build products that leverage the full vertical stack — content creation (NBCUniversal), distribution (Xfinity broadband + cable), and direct-to-consumer (Peacock streaming). This integration enables product strategies that are impossible at pure-play streaming or pure-play broadband companies. PMs who can think across these business boundaries and identify cross-platform product opportunities are exceptionally valuable to Comcast's growth strategy.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cross-Platform Product Strategy:** "My role spans products across Comcast's vertically integrated portfolio — broadband, streaming, and media. This cross-platform PM scope is equivalent to a Senior/Principal PM at single-product companies. I'd like the compensation to reflect this broader strategic impact at $[X]K total comp."

2. **Revenue Ownership:** "I'll have direct ownership of product metrics that map to revenue — subscriber growth, ARPU, retention rates, and advertising yield. PMs with direct P&L accountability are compensated at a premium, and I'd like the base and RSU to reflect this at $[X]K base and $[Y]K RSUs."

3. **Big Tech PM Competition:** "The market for experienced PMs is extremely competitive, with Google, Meta, and Amazon offering $[X]K+ total comp for similar scope. While I'm excited about Comcast's unique product challenges, the package needs to be competitive. Can we discuss increasing the overall comp to $[X]K?"

4. **Transformation Leadership:** "Comcast's product transformation — from cable utility to consumer tech experience — requires PMs who have led similar transformations. My experience at [company] driving [transformation] positions me to accelerate Comcast's product evolution, and the compensation should reflect this strategic value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm genuinely excited about this PM role — owning product strategy across Comcast's media-tech portfolio is a rare opportunity. To align with my market value, I'd like to discuss: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[130-150]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[30-45]K. My competing offer from [Google/Amazon/Netflix] is at $[X]K total comp. At approximately $[260-300]K, I believe this package reflects the cross-platform scope and P&L ownership of this role. I'm ready to accept if we can find alignment."
