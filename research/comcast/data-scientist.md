### Data Scientist | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Consumer Analytics at Scale | Advertising + Streaming Intelligence

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $135K–$195K | $40K–$140K | 10-15% | $165K–$280K |
| Denver / Seattle | $130K–$190K | $35K–$130K | 10-15% | $155K–$265K |
| London (UK) | £100K–£145K | £25K–£100K | 10-15% | $125K–$210K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Comcast work at the intersection of media, telecommunications, and consumer technology — building models that optimize everything from Peacock content recommendations and advertising targeting to Xfinity network capacity planning and customer churn prediction. With 30M+ broadband customers and 35M+ Peacock subscribers generating petabytes of behavioral data, Comcast offers Data Scientists a playground of consumer insights at a scale that few companies can match. The vertically integrated business model means your models can draw from broadband usage patterns, streaming viewership, advertising engagement, and customer interaction data — creating a multi-dimensional view of consumer behavior.

Comcast has significantly increased its investment in data science capabilities, building dedicated teams for Peacock analytics, Xfinity customer intelligence, and NBCUniversal advertising optimization. Compensation reflects this investment, with total comp reaching $280K for senior data scientists in high-cost markets.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast Data Scientist (T3-T5) = Google L3-L5 DS = Meta E3-E5 DS = Amazon DS II-III = Microsoft 60-63

**Comcast Analytics Premium**

Comcast's data science teams have a direct line to revenue impact. Peacock recommendation models drive subscriber retention and engagement metrics that Wall Street watches closely. Advertising targeting models determine CPM rates and fill rates across NBCUniversal's portfolio. Customer churn models directly impact Xfinity's retention rates and customer lifetime value. Data Scientists at Comcast are not building models for abstract insights — they are building revenue and retention engines for a $170B company.

**Global Levers**

1. **Multi-Domain Analytics Expertise:** "I bring data science experience across [streaming/advertising/telecommunications], which directly aligns with Comcast's cross-business analytics needs. The ability to build models that leverage data from broadband, streaming, and media simultaneously is rare — I'd like compensation that reflects this cross-domain expertise at $[X]K total comp."

2. **Revenue-Impacting Models:** "The models I'll build directly impact Comcast's revenue — from Peacock recommendation algorithms that drive subscriber retention to advertising targeting models that determine CPM rates. This direct P&L impact warrants a higher RSU grant of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **AI/ML Talent Premium:** "The market for data scientists with production ML experience is extremely competitive. I have a competing offer from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm drawn to Comcast's unique cross-business data opportunities, the package needs to be competitive with pure tech alternatives."

4. **Strategic Intelligence Value:** "Beyond tactical model building, I'll provide strategic intelligence that informs Comcast's competitive positioning in streaming, broadband, and advertising. This executive-level impact goes beyond standard data science roles and should be reflected in the compensation package."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. The opportunity to build data science solutions across Comcast's broadband, streaming, and media businesses is genuinely compelling. To make this work financially, I'd like to discuss: a base increase to $[X+10-15]K, RSU grant of $[Y+30-50]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[20-35]K to offset unvested equity. My competing offer from [competitor] is $[TC]K, and these adjustments would bring the Comcast package in line while reflecting the multi-business revenue impact of this data science role. I'm excited to join and ready to accept if we can align."
