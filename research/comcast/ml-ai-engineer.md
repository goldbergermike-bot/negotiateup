### ML/AI Engineer | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | AI-Powered Content & Network Intelligence | **+10-20% AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $150K–$215K | $55K–$170K | 12-15% | $195K–$325K |
| Denver / Seattle | $145K–$210K | $50K–$160K | 12-15% | $185K–$310K |
| London (UK) | £110K–£155K | £38K–£120K | 12-15% | $150K–$245K |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Comcast are building the intelligence layer that powers a $170B media-tech empire. From Peacock's content recommendation engine (driving subscriber engagement and retention) to Xfinity's predictive network maintenance (reducing outages for 30M+ customers) to NBCUniversal's advertising optimization (maximizing ad revenue across linear and streaming), AI touches every critical business function at Comcast. The company has made AI a strategic priority, investing heavily in ML infrastructure, hiring AI leadership from Big Tech, and deploying AI/ML across its entire portfolio.

The AI Premium of 10-20% over standard engineering compensation reflects the acute talent scarcity in production ML engineering. Engineers who can build, deploy, and maintain ML models at consumer scale — particularly in recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, and predictive analytics — are among the most sought-after in the industry.

**Level Mapping:** Comcast ML/AI Engineer (T4-T5) = Google L4-L5 ML Engineer = Meta E4-E5 ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist II-III = Microsoft 62-64

**Comcast AI Investment Premium**

Comcast's AI ambitions span the entire media-tech stack. Peacock uses ML for content recommendations, personalization, and ad targeting. Xfinity deploys AI for predictive network maintenance, customer service automation, and smart home intelligence. NBCUniversal leverages AI for content analytics, audience measurement, and advertising optimization. This breadth of AI applications creates unique opportunities for ML engineers who want to work across multiple domains — and the business impact of AI at Comcast is measured in billions of dollars of influenced revenue.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Talent Scarcity Premium:** "ML/AI engineers with production experience are among the most sought-after in tech. I have competing offers from [Google/Meta/Amazon/OpenAI] at $[X]K total comp that include significant AI premiums. Comcast's offer should include a comparable AI premium to attract talent from this highly competitive pool — I'm looking for a total comp of $[X]K."

2. **Multi-Domain AI Impact:** "I'll apply ML/AI across Comcast's entire portfolio — recommendation systems for Peacock, predictive maintenance for Xfinity, and advertising optimization for NBCUniversal. This cross-business AI impact is rare and creates outsized value. I'd like the RSU grant to be $[Y]K to reflect this multi-domain leverage."

3. **Direct Revenue Attribution:** "The ML models I build will directly impact measurable business metrics: Peacock subscriber retention rates, Xfinity network uptime, and advertising CPM rates. These are not research projects — they are production systems with direct P&L attribution. My compensation should reflect this revenue-generating role."

4. **AI Infrastructure Investment:** "I'll be helping build Comcast's AI/ML infrastructure and best practices, not just individual models. This foundational work enables all future AI initiatives across the company — a strategic investment that pays dividends across every business unit."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the ML/AI opportunity at Comcast — applying AI across streaming, broadband, and media is a unique cross-domain challenge. I hold a competing offer from [Google/Meta/OpenAI] at $[X]K total comp including an AI premium. To make Comcast competitive, I'd like to discuss: a base of $[200-215]K, RSU grant of $[150-170]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[30-45]K. At $[280-325]K total comp, this reflects both the AI talent premium and the multi-business impact of this role. I'm ready to commit if we can align on this package."
