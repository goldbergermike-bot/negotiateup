### Product Designer | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Consumer Experience at Scale | Xfinity + Peacock UX

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $120K–$175K | $30K–$110K | 10-15% | $145K–$235K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Comcast shape the experience of 65M+ consumers across Xfinity, Peacock, and NBCUniversal products. This is consumer-scale design work — your decisions about navigation flows, content discovery, accessibility, and interaction patterns directly impact how millions of Americans interact with their broadband service, stream content on Peacock, or engage with NBC entertainment. Comcast has invested significantly in elevating its design practice, hiring design leadership from Apple, Google, and Airbnb to transform the company's reputation from a traditional utility into a modern consumer experience company.

The Xfinity brand redesign, Peacock streaming interface, and smart home app experience represent major design investments that have materially improved customer satisfaction scores and Net Promoter Scores. Product Designers who continue this trajectory — bringing Big Tech design sensibility to Comcast's consumer products — are highly valued and increasingly well-compensated.

**Comcast Design Investment Premium**

Comcast has transformed its approach to design, moving from an engineering-first culture to one that places product design as a strategic function. The company's design teams now have significant influence over product direction, and designers work on a portfolio of products that spans streaming, broadband, smart home, and entertainment. This breadth of design challenges — from designing a streaming app used by millions to creating smart home interfaces to reimagining cable TV navigation — is uniquely diverse.

**Global Levers**

1. **Consumer Scale Impact:** "My designs will impact 65M+ consumers across Xfinity and Peacock. At this scale, even small UX improvements in conversion, engagement, or task completion translate to millions in revenue impact. I'd like a base of $[X]K that reflects the scale of this design impact."

2. **Brand Transformation Value:** "Comcast's brand transformation from traditional cable company to modern tech experience depends on world-class design. I bring [portfolio examples] demonstrating my ability to elevate consumer experiences — this strategic design leadership warrants an RSU grant of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Multi-Platform Design Expertise:** "I'll design across streaming, broadband, and smart home platforms — each with distinct user contexts and interaction patterns. This multi-platform design expertise is rare and valuable. Designers who can maintain design coherence across such diverse product lines command premium compensation."

4. **Competing Design Offers:** "I have a competing offer from [Apple/Google/Airbnb] at $[X]K total comp. While I'm excited about Comcast's design transformation, I need the package to be competitive with companies that have more established design cultures. Can we close the gap?"

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the design opportunity — shaping the experience for 65M+ consumers across Comcast's products is exactly the kind of impact I'm looking for. To align with my market value: a base increase to $[X+10-15]K, RSU grant of $[Y+20-35]K, and a signing bonus of $[15-25]K. My competing offer is $[TC]K, and these adjustments bring the Comcast offer in line while reflecting the strategic importance of design to Comcast's brand transformation. I'm ready to accept."
