### Senior Software Engineer | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $170B Media-Tech Conglomerate | Xfinity + Peacock + NBCUniversal | Senior Technical Leadership

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $155K–$215K | $60K–$170K | 12-15% | $200K–$325K |
| Denver / Seattle | $150K–$210K | $55K–$160K | 12-15% | $190K–$310K |
| London (UK) | £115K–£160K | £40K–£120K | 12-15% | $155K–$250K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Comcast are the technical backbone of a $170B media-technology conglomerate. At this level, you own the architecture and implementation of systems that power Xfinity's 30M+ customer broadband platform, Peacock's streaming infrastructure, or NBCUniversal's content delivery pipeline. Comcast has invested heavily in attracting senior engineering talent from Big Tech, and Senior SWEs are expected to drive technical decisions, mentor junior engineers, and deliver complex projects that span multiple teams and platforms.

The Senior SWE band at Comcast represents a significant step up in compensation, with base salaries reaching $215K, RSU grants up to $170K over four years, and bonuses of 12-15%. Comcast's total comp at this level ($200K-$325K) is competitive with mid-tier Big Tech offers and exceeds most traditional media and telecom companies. The company has recognized that competing for senior talent requires packages that approach Big Tech levels, particularly for engineers working on Peacock, Xfinity platform, and data infrastructure.

**Comcast Technology Investment Premium**

Comcast spends $5B+ annually on technology and has built engineering centers of excellence that rival those of pure tech companies. Senior engineers at Comcast have an outsized impact because they operate at the intersection of telecommunications, media, and technology — defining architecture decisions that affect millions of customers across multiple business lines. The company's vertically integrated model means a Senior SWE might architect a system that touches content delivery, broadband networking, and streaming simultaneously — a breadth of impact that is rare at companies focused on a single domain.

**Global Levers**

1. **Senior-Level Technical Ownership:** "At the Senior SWE level, I'll own architecture decisions that impact Comcast's core platforms serving tens of millions of customers. This level of technical ownership and cross-platform influence warrants top-of-band compensation. I'd like to discuss a base of $[200-215]K to reflect senior-level accountability."

2. **Big Tech Competitive Counter:** "I have competing offers from [Google/Meta/Amazon] at the L5/E5/SDE III level with total comp of $[350-420]K. While I'm drawn to Comcast's unique media-tech challenges, the compensation gap needs to narrow. Increasing the RSU component to $[150-170]K over four years would make this offer competitive."

3. **Cross-Domain Architecture Expertise:** "My experience spanning [streaming/broadband/cloud infrastructure] directly aligns with Comcast's vertically integrated architecture needs. Senior engineers who can architect across content, distribution, and streaming domains are rare — and I bring that cross-domain perspective. I'd like the package to reflect this at $[X]K total comp."

4. **Retention and Growth Investment:** "Comcast's technology transformation depends on retaining senior engineering talent. I've seen Comcast's investment in engineering culture and I'm excited about the trajectory — but the initial offer needs to reflect the market for senior engineers who can lead this transformation. A signing bonus of $[30-50]K to bridge the first-year gap would demonstrate that investment."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I appreciate the offer and I'm excited about the Senior SWE role — leading technical decisions across Comcast's platforms is exactly the kind of impact I'm looking for. I'd like to discuss adjustments to align with my market value: a base increase to $[205-215]K, RSU grant of $[150-170]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[35-50]K to offset unvested equity. This brings total comp to $[280-325]K, which reflects both the competitive senior engineering market and the cross-platform impact of this role at a $170B company. I have a competing offer from [competitor] at $[X]K, and I'd prefer to join Comcast — let's find a package that works for both sides."
