**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Comcast design the technical architecture that connects the company's complex ecosystem — Xfinity broadband, Peacock streaming, NBCUniversal media, and Comcast Business enterprise services. This is a role that requires both deep technical expertise and strong business acumen, as Solutions Architects must translate business requirements into scalable technical designs that work across Comcast's vertically integrated portfolio. Whether you're architecting enterprise solutions for Comcast Business customers, designing integration patterns between Peacock and Xfinity, or building the technical framework for new NBCUniversal digital products, you are shaping the technical future of a $170B company.

Solutions Architects at Comcast operate at the intersection of pre-sales, engineering, and product — working with enterprise customers, internal business units, and engineering teams to design solutions that leverage Comcast's full technology stack. The role commands strong compensation because it requires a rare combination of architectural depth, communication skills, and business understanding.

**Comcast Enterprise + Consumer Architecture Premium**

Comcast's Solutions Architects have a unique advantage: they can design solutions that leverage both consumer infrastructure (broadband network, streaming platform, content delivery) and enterprise capabilities (Comcast Business, managed services, SD-WAN). This dual consumer-enterprise expertise is rare and enables differentiated solutions that pure-play cloud providers or enterprise-only companies cannot match.

**Global Levers**

1. **Dual Consumer-Enterprise Architecture:** "I'll design solutions that span both Comcast's consumer and enterprise portfolios — a unique architectural challenge that requires expertise across streaming, broadband, and enterprise services. This cross-domain architecture skill set is rare and valuable. I'd like a base of $[X]K reflecting this breadth."

2. **Revenue-Generating Architecture:** "Solutions Architects directly influence enterprise deal sizes and customer retention through technical design quality. My architectural recommendations will inform multi-million-dollar enterprise contracts for Comcast Business. This direct revenue influence warrants RSUs of $[Y]K over four years."

3. **Cloud + Network Architecture Hybrid:** "Comcast's unique position — owning both network infrastructure and cloud-delivered services — requires architects who understand both worlds. My experience with [cloud platforms] and [network architecture] is exactly this hybrid expertise. I'd like total comp of $[X]K to reflect this."

4. **Competing Architecture Offers:** "I have competing offers from [AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft Azure] at $[X]K total comp for solutions architecture roles. While Comcast's full-stack integration opportunity is more compelling, the compensation needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm excited about the Solutions Architect role — designing technical solutions that leverage Comcast's full portfolio is a unique architectural challenge. To align with my market value: a base of $[190-205]K, RSU grant of $[130-150]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-40]K. My competing offer from [AWS/Google Cloud] is $[X]K total comp. At approximately $[265-305]K, this reflects the revenue-generating nature of solutions architecture and the cross-domain expertise required. I'm ready to commit."
