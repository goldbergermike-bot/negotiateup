**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Comcast protect one of the most critical infrastructure environments in the United States. With 30M+ broadband customers, 35M+ Peacock subscribers, and NBCUniversal's media operations, the attack surface is enormous — spanning telecommunications networks, streaming platforms, consumer data, payment systems, and content protection (DRM). Comcast processes millions of financial transactions, stores massive amounts of personally identifiable information, and operates broadband infrastructure that qualifies as critical national infrastructure. A security breach at Comcast could affect tens of millions of Americans, making the Security Engineer role both high-stakes and high-impact.

Comcast has invested heavily in its security program, building a dedicated cybersecurity organization that rivals those of major financial institutions. The company operates its own Security Operations Center (SOC), threat intelligence team, and red team — and Security Engineers are embedded across all business units to ensure security is built into products from the ground up.

**Comcast Critical Infrastructure Premium**

Comcast's security requirements exceed those of most technology companies because the company operates critical telecommunications infrastructure, processes consumer financial data, and protects premium entertainment content. This multi-domain security challenge — network security, application security, data protection, DRM, and compliance — requires engineers with breadth across security domains and depth in at least one specialty. The regulatory environment (FCC, CPNI, PCI-DSS, GDPR) adds another layer of complexity that increases the value of experienced security engineers.

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical Infrastructure Scope:** "I'll protect critical telecommunications infrastructure serving 30M+ Americans, consumer data for 65M+ users, and premium content worth billions. The scope and stakes of security at Comcast exceed most tech companies. I'd like a base of $[X]K reflecting this critical responsibility."

2. **Security Talent Scarcity:** "The cybersecurity talent shortage is well-documented — there are 3.5M+ unfilled security positions globally. My experience in [application security/network security/cloud security] at [company] makes me part of a very small talent pool for this role. I'd like the total comp to reflect this scarcity at $[X]K."

3. **Multi-Domain Security Expertise:** "Comcast's security challenges span telecom networks, streaming platforms, consumer data, and content protection. I bring experience across [multiple security domains], which is exactly the breadth Comcast needs. This cross-domain expertise commands premium compensation."

4. **Regulatory Compliance Value:** "I'll help Comcast navigate a complex regulatory landscape — FCC, CPNI, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and state privacy laws. Non-compliance penalties can be hundreds of millions of dollars. My compliance expertise directly protects Comcast's bottom line and reputation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer. Comcast's security challenges are among the most complex in the industry — protecting critical infrastructure, consumer data, and premium content simultaneously. To align with market rates for this scope: a base of $[185-200]K, RSU grant of $[120-145]K over four years, and a signing bonus of $[25-40]K. My competing offer from [CrowdStrike/Palo Alto/Google] is $[X]K total comp. At approximately $[250-290]K, this reflects both the security talent premium and the critical nature of this role at a $170B infrastructure company. I'm ready to accept."
