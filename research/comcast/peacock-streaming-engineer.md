### Peacock Streaming Engineer | Comcast Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** NBCUniversal Streaming Platform | Peacock Growth Engine | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-20% STREAMING PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Philadelphia / NYC | $155K–$210K | $60K–$170K | 12-15% | $200K–$325K |
| Denver / Seattle | $150K–$205K | $55K–$160K | 12-15% | $190K–$310K |
| London (UK) | £115K–£155K | £40K–£120K | 12-15% | $155K–$240K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The Peacock Streaming Engineer is Comcast's signature technical role — building and scaling the streaming platform that anchors NBCUniversal's direct-to-consumer strategy. Peacock has grown to 35M+ paid subscribers and is central to Comcast's transformation from a legacy cable company into a modern media-tech powerhouse. You are building the video delivery infrastructure, content recommendation engines, ad-serving systems, and playback services that compete directly with Netflix, Disney+, and Max. Comcast's $170B market cap and vertically integrated model (content creation via NBCUniversal + distribution via Xfinity + streaming via Peacock) creates unique engineering challenges that span the entire media delivery pipeline.

This role commands a 15-20% streaming premium over standard Comcast engineering compensation because Peacock engineers require specialized expertise in video encoding, adaptive bitrate streaming, real-time ad insertion, and content delivery at scale. The talent market for streaming platform engineers is exceptionally competitive, with Netflix, Disney+, Max, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube all aggressively recruiting from the same pool.

**Comcast Streaming Premium — Peacock's Strategic Importance**

Peacock is not a side project — it is the centerpiece of Comcast's content strategy and the primary vehicle for monetizing NBCUniversal's content library in the streaming era. Comcast has invested billions in Peacock, and the platform's growth is a top priority discussed in every earnings call. Engineers building Peacock are directly responsible for subscriber growth, ad revenue, and the viewer experience that determines whether Comcast can compete with the streaming giants. The vertical integration advantage — owning both the content (NBCUniversal) and the distribution (Xfinity) — creates unique engineering opportunities and challenges that no pure-play streaming company faces.

**Global Levers**

1. **Signature Role — Peacock's Technical Foundation:** "I'm building the streaming platform that is central to Comcast's $170B business strategy. Peacock competes directly with Netflix, Disney+, and Max — and the quality of the engineering directly determines subscriber growth and retention. Engineers with streaming platform expertise are among the most sought-after in media tech, and I'd like compensation that reflects this role's strategic importance to Comcast's future."

2. **Streaming Talent Scarcity Premium:** "The market for engineers with video streaming, adaptive bitrate, and real-time ad insertion expertise is extremely competitive. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube are all recruiting from the same talent pool with packages of $300K-$450K+ total comp. I'd like to discuss increasing the RSU grant to $[X] to ensure this offer is competitive with my alternatives in streaming engineering."

3. **Vertical Integration Complexity:** "Comcast's unique vertical integration — content creation, cable distribution, broadband infrastructure, and streaming — creates engineering challenges that don't exist at pure-play streaming companies. I'll be building systems that span the entire media delivery pipeline, from content ingestion to last-mile delivery over Xfinity networks. This cross-domain expertise is rare and valuable."

4. **Ad Revenue Growth Engine:** "Peacock's ad-supported tier is a critical revenue driver, and the ad-tech infrastructure I'll build directly impacts advertising revenue. Every improvement in ad targeting, ad load optimization, and programmatic buying efficiency translates directly to Peacock's P&L. I'd like my compensation to reflect this direct revenue impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm very excited about the opportunity to build Peacock's streaming platform — the combination of NBCUniversal's content library and Comcast's distribution infrastructure creates a unique engineering challenge. I hold a competing offer from [Netflix/Disney+/Amazon Prime Video] at $[X] total comp. While I'm drawn to Peacock's growth trajectory and Comcast's vertical integration story, I'd like to discuss adjusting the offer to $[200K] base and $[150K] RSUs over four years. This reflects both the streaming talent premium and my specific expertise in [video delivery/ad-tech/recommendation systems]. At a total comp of $[290K-$310K], I believe this is a fair reflection of the strategic value of this role. I'm ready to commit if we can align on these numbers."
