**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Unity work on AI that spans game development tools, ad optimization, and engine intelligence. Unity's ML-Agents toolkit is an open-source platform for training intelligent game agents using reinforcement learning. Unity Muse and Unity Sentis represent the company's push into AI-powered game creation — text-to-game-asset generation, AI-assisted coding, and on-device ML inference within the Unity runtime. On the ads side, ML engineers build the recommendation and targeting models that power Unity's advertising platform (billions of daily impressions). Unity's unique position at the intersection of game development tools and AI creates ML/AI roles that don't exist at pure gaming or pure AI companies. Post-restructuring, Unity has doubled down on AI as a differentiator against Unreal Engine. [Source: Unity AI, ML-Agents, Unity Muse/Sentis 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Unity ML Engineer (L4) = Google L4-L5 ML = Meta E4-E5 ML

**Global Levers**

1. **Unity Muse/Sentis AI Strategy:** "Unity Muse (AI-assisted creation) and Sentis (on-device ML inference) represent Unity's differentiation strategy against Unreal. ML engineers building these products are defining Unity's competitive future."
2. **Ad-Tech ML at Scale:** "Unity's ad optimization ML processes billions of impressions daily. The scale and revenue impact of ad-tech ML rivals Meta and Google's mobile ads teams."
3. **ML-Agents Open Source Prestige:** "Unity ML-Agents is one of the most-used RL training environments in the ML community. Contributing to this open-source project has significant career and research value."
4. **On-Device ML Innovation:** "Unity Sentis enables ML inference directly in the game runtime on mobile devices. Building on-device ML that runs efficiently on billions of constrained devices is a unique and technically demanding challenge."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $315K TC — $220K base, $200K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus with the AI premium applied. My ML expertise in [generative AI/RL/ad-tech ML] maps directly to Unity's highest-priority AI initiatives." Accept at $160K+ RSUs with $205K+ base.
