### Senior Software Engineer | Unity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Post-IPO Comp Stabilizing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$220K | $80K–$210K | 10% | $215K–$330K |
| Austin | $140K–$195K | $65K–$175K | 10% | $185K–$290K |
| Copenhagen | DKK 500K–DKK 770K | DKK 180K–DKK 350K | 10% | DKK 730K–DKK 1.2M |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Unity (L4) own major subsystems in the engine, editor, or platform services. At the Senior level, Unity's RSU grants become meaningful, and the stock's volatility creates an asymmetric bet — if Unity executes its strategic refocus, Senior SWEs with recovery-priced RSU grants will benefit significantly. Senior engineers at Unity are the backbone of the company's technical rebuilding — they're reimplementing the runtime, optimizing the editor, building the new data-oriented technology stack (DOTS/ECS), and expanding platform support. Unity's flat engineering culture gives Senior SWEs significant architectural influence. The company's distributed workforce (SF, Austin, Montreal, Copenhagen) means many Senior SWEs work across time zones, requiring strong asynchronous collaboration skills.

**Level Mapping:** Unity Senior SWE (L4) = Google L4 = Meta E4 = Epic Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Stock Recovery Upside:** "Unity's stock is below its 2021 highs but the company is refocusing on its core engine business. RSUs granted now have meaningful recovery upside. I want a larger grant to maximize this asymmetric opportunity."
2. **DOTS/ECS Technical Depth:** If your role involves Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack: "DOTS/ECS is Unity's next-generation architecture. Engineers with data-oriented design expertise are building the future of the engine."
3. **Cross-Platform Expertise:** "Unity targets 20+ platforms. Senior engineers who understand platform-specific optimization across mobile, console, and PC are extremely valuable."
4. **Competitive Market Positioning:** "Post-restructuring, Unity needs to attract and retain strong Senior engineers to execute the strategic refocus. My skills in [area] are exactly what Unity needs right now."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $305K TC — $210K base, $185K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. Unity's refocus on core engine technology creates high-impact opportunities for Senior engineers, and I want the equity to reflect the recovery potential." Push RSUs to $150K+. Accept if TC exceeds $275K.
