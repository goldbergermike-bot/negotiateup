**Negotiation DNA**

This is Unity's signature engineering role — the Runtime Platform Engineer. You are building the core runtime that powers 70%+ of mobile games worldwide, plus growing adoption in AR/VR, automotive, film, and industrial applications. Unity's runtime is the execution engine that ships inside every Unity-built application — its performance, size, and platform compatibility directly determine Unity's market position against Unreal Engine. Unity ($20B market cap) has been through significant turbulence — the runtime fee controversy of 2023, CEO transition, and strategic refocus on core engine technology. Post-stabilization, Unity is doubling down on runtime performance, particularly for mobile and embedded platforms where Unity dominates. Runtime Platform Engineers work on the most technically demanding layer of Unity's stack: memory management, rendering pipelines, physics, scripting runtimes (IL2CPP, Mono), and cross-platform compilation targeting 20+ platforms.

**Level Mapping:** Unity Senior Runtime Eng = Google L4-L5 = Meta E4-E5 = Epic Unreal Senior Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Runtime Platform Engineer builds the foundation that every Unity game runs on:
- **Cross-Platform Runtime:** Targeting 20+ platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, PS5, Xbox, Switch, WebGL, AR/VR headsets) from a single codebase
- **Mobile Performance Optimization:** Unity's dominance in mobile gaming means runtime performance on constrained devices is critical — memory footprint, battery efficiency, thermal management
- **Scripting Runtime (IL2CPP/Mono):** Engineering the .NET-to-native compilation pipeline that converts C# game code to optimized native code across all platforms
- **Rendering Pipeline (URP/HDRP):** Building the rendering systems that balance visual quality and performance across the widest range of hardware in the industry

**Global Levers**

1. **70% Mobile Market Share:** "Unity powers 70%+ of mobile games globally. The runtime I'm building is the most widely-deployed game engine in the world. My comp should reflect this extraordinary market reach."
2. **Post-Controversy Rebuilding Premium:** "Unity is in a rebuilding phase after the runtime fee controversy. Engineers joining now are rebuilding developer trust — that's harder and more valuable than maintaining an already-healthy relationship."
3. **Engine Runtime Scarcity (10-20%):** "Game engine runtime engineers are the scarcest talent pool in gaming technology. Fewer than 500 engineers globally have production experience building cross-platform game engine runtimes."
4. **20+ Platform Target Complexity:** "No other software targets as many platforms as Unity's runtime. The cross-compilation, platform-specific optimization, and testing matrix is staggeringly complex."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm building the runtime for the world's most widely-deployed game engine. I'd like $230K base, $230K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus with the runtime premium applied. Unity's market position depends on runtime performance, and my engine expertise directly protects that position. Competing offers from Epic/Apple/Google graphics teams are at [X]." Unity will counter at $160K–$190K RSUs. Accept at $190K+ RSUs with sign-on of $25K–$40K.
