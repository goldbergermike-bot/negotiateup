### Staff Software Engineer | Unity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Post-IPO Comp Stabilizing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$260K | $150K–$340K | 10–15% | $305K–$465K |
| Austin | $175K–$235K | $125K–$285K | 10–15% | $265K–$405K |
| Copenhagen | DKK 650K–DKK 950K | DKK 300K–DKK 550K | 10% | DKK 1.0M–DKK 1.6M |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Unity (L5) are principal-level architects who define the technical direction for entire engine subsystems or platform services. At the Staff level, Unity's RSU grants are substantial, and the stock's depressed price (relative to 2021 highs) means grants sized in shares represent significant recovery upside. Staff SWEs at Unity are critical to the company's strategic rebuild — they're the architects deciding how to modernize the engine, optimize the runtime, and expand into new markets (AR/VR, automotive, digital twins). Unity has fewer Staff-level positions than comparable companies, making each one strategically important. Staff engineers often represent the technical continuity through Unity's leadership transitions and restructuring. [Source: Unity L5 Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Unity Staff SWE (L5) = Google L5 = Meta E5 = Epic Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Recovery Equity Bet:** "At Staff level, RSU grants are large enough that stock recovery creates meaningful wealth. If Unity's stock returns to $100+ (from current levels), a $300K RSU grant could be worth $500K+. I want the grant sized to maximize this upside."
2. **Architecture Authority:** "As a Staff SWE, I'm defining Unity's engine architecture for the next 5-10 years. This technical direction directly determines Unity's competitive position against Unreal Engine."
3. **Post-Restructuring Scarcity:** "Unity lost many Staff-level engineers during the 2023-2024 restructuring. The remaining Staff positions carry more scope and influence — my comp should reflect this increased responsibility."
4. **FAANG Staff Benchmarking:** "Google L5 and Meta E5 in SF are $400K-$500K TC with stable equity. Unity needs to be competitive — either through larger RSU grants or higher base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $430K TC — $250K base, $300K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus. At Staff level, I'm defining Unity's engine architecture during the most critical rebuilding period in the company's history. FAANG alternatives are at $450K+." Accept at $250K+ RSUs with $240K+ base.
