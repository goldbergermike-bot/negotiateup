**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Unity shape the user experience of the Unity Editor — the most widely-used game development environment in the world, with millions of developers relying on it daily. Unity Editor UX is one of the most complex design challenges in software: a 3D creative environment that must serve hobbyist indie developers, professional AAA studios, and enterprise customers building automotive simulations or architectural visualizations. Unlike consumer UX, game engine design requires understanding 3D spatial interfaces, real-time preview, asset pipeline workflows, and the unique creative processes of game development. Unity's design function has become more strategic post-restructuring as the company focuses on improving the editor experience to compete with Unreal Engine's polished tooling.
