**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Unity shape the user experience of the Unity Editor — the most widely-used game development environment in the world, with millions of developers relying on it daily. Unity Editor UX is one of the most complex design challenges in software: a 3D creative environment that must serve hobbyist indie developers, professional AAA studios, and enterprise customers building automotive simulations or architectural visualizations. Unlike consumer UX, game engine design requires understanding 3D spatial interfaces, real-time preview, asset pipeline workflows, and the unique creative processes of game development. Unity's design function has become more strategic post-restructuring as the company focuses on improving the editor experience to compete with Unreal Engine's polished tooling.

**Level Mapping:** Unity Designer (L3-L4) = Google L4 UX = Figma Designer = Adobe Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **3D Creative Tools Expertise:** "Designing a 3D game development environment is one of the hardest UX challenges in software. My experience with [3D tools/creative software/complex UI] directly transfers to Unity's most important design challenges."
2. **Millions of Developer Users:** "Unity Editor is used by millions of developers daily. My design decisions impact a massive and technically sophisticated user base."
3. **Competitive UX Gap:** "Unity's editor UX is widely acknowledged as needing improvement compared to Unreal. Designers joining now can have transformative impact on the developer experience."
4. **Post-Restructuring Design Impact:** "Unity's smaller, more focused design team means each designer has greater influence on the product. I'm not one of hundreds — I'm one of a select few shaping the editor experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $240K TC — $180K base, $130K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. My experience designing complex creative tools directly maps to Unity's editor UX challenges." Accept at $100K+ RSUs with $165K+ base.
