**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Unity leverage one of the largest mobile ecosystem datasets in the world — billions of devices, hundreds of billions of ad impressions, and telemetry from 70%+ of mobile games. DS roles at Unity span ad optimization (predicting ad engagement, optimizing fill rates, fraud detection), developer analytics (helping game developers understand player behavior), and engine optimization (using telemetry to prioritize engine improvements). Unity's advertising DS team operates at ad-tech scale, competing with Meta and Google for mobile ad spend. DS roles on the engine team analyze crash data, performance telemetry, and developer usage patterns to guide engine development priorities. The combination of ad-tech DS and developer-tools DS creates a unique and intellectually stimulating environment. [Source: Unity DS, Ads Optimization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Unity Senior Data Scientist (L4) = Google L4 DS = Meta IC4 DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Mobile Ecosystem Dataset:** "Unity's dataset spans billions of devices and 70%+ of mobile games. This is one of the richest mobile ecosystem datasets in the world — comparable to Meta or Google in the mobile ads space."
2. **Ad Optimization at Scale:** "Unity's advertising platform competes with Meta and Google for mobile ad dollars. DS/ML models that improve ad targeting, fill rates, or fraud detection have direct revenue impact measured in millions."
3. **Developer-Facing Analytics:** "Unity Analytics helps game developers understand player behavior. Building models that help developers succeed creates network effects — more successful developers means more Unity adoption."
4. **Ad-Tech DS Premium:** "Ad-tech DS at Unity's scale commands a premium over general DS roles. My experience in [ad optimization/recommendation systems/fraud detection] directly maps to Unity's highest-value DS work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K TC — $200K base, $160K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. My ad-tech DS experience at scale maps directly to Unity's advertising platform optimization." Accept at $125K+ RSUs with $185K+ base.
