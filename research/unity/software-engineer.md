**Negotiation DNA**

Unity Technologies ($20B market cap, San Francisco) builds the world's most widely-used game engine, powering 70%+ of mobile games and expanding into AR/VR, automotive, film, and industrial applications. Unity's comp model includes base + RSUs + annual bonus (10%), with RSUs in publicly-traded U stock. Unity's stock has been volatile since the 2023 runtime fee controversy and CEO transition — this creates both risk and opportunity in the equity component. Unity has been through significant restructuring (layoffs in 2023-2024), and the company is now focused on its core engine business after divesting non-core assets. Engineers joining Unity now are part of a rebuilding phase — the company is refocusing on what made it great (the engine) and needs strong engineers to execute this strategy. Post-IPO comp has stabilized but remains competitive, especially for engine and runtime roles. [Source: Unity FY2026 Investor Report, Engineering Organization]

**Level Mapping:** Unity SWE (L3) = Google L3 = Meta E3 = Epic SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Stock Volatility Hedge:** "Unity's stock has been volatile. I'd like the RSU grant sized generously to hedge against potential downside — if U stock recovers to its 2021 highs, this grant could be worth significantly more."
2. **Rebuilding Phase Opportunity:** "Unity is in a strategic rebuilding phase. Engineers joining now have outsized opportunity to shape the company's direction and earn recognition that translates to promotions and equity refreshes."
3. **70% Mobile Market Share:** "Unity's engine powers 70%+ of mobile games. As an engineer building this platform, my work reaches billions of end users across millions of applications."
4. **Post-Layoff Lean Org:** "Unity's engineering org is leaner post-restructuring. Each new hire carries more scope and impact. My comp should reflect this increased per-engineer value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open with: "I'm targeting $245K TC — $180K base, $140K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. Unity's rebuilding phase means high-impact opportunities for engineers joining now, and I want the equity to reflect both the current value and recovery upside." Unity will counter at $80K–$100K RSUs. Push to $110K+ with sign-on of $10K–$20K. Accept if TC exceeds $220K.
