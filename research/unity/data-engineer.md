### Data Engineer | Unity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Post-IPO Comp Stabilizing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $145K–$200K | $60K–$170K | 10% | $185K–$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Unity build the pipelines and infrastructure that process data from billions of app installs running Unity's runtime and monetization SDK. Unity's data platform is massive — the Unity Ads network, Unity Analytics, and runtime telemetry generate petabytes of data from games installed on billions of devices worldwide. This data powers Unity's advertising business (a significant revenue stream), analytics products offered to developers, and internal engine optimization decisions. Data engineers at Unity work at a scale that rivals the largest ad-tech companies — processing ad impressions, click events, attribution data, and real-time bidding signals. Post-restructuring, Unity's data platform team has refocused on core data infrastructure that supports both the engine business and the monetization platform.

**Level Mapping:** Unity Data Engineer (L3-L4) = Google L3-L4 DE = Meta E3-E4 DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Ad-Tech Scale Data:** "Unity's advertising platform processes billions of ad impressions daily. This is ad-tech scale data engineering with real-time bidding, attribution, and optimization requirements."
2. **Billions of Runtime Installs:** "Unity's runtime is installed on billions of devices. The telemetry from this install base creates one of the largest device and user behavior datasets in mobile."
3. **Dual Data Domain:** "Unity's data platform serves both the engine (developer telemetry, crash reporting, performance analytics) and the ads business (impression data, attribution, fraud detection). This dual-domain complexity is unique."
4. **RSU Recovery Opportunity:** "I want a generous RSU grant at current stock prices. Data engineering is critical infrastructure for Unity's ads revenue and engine optimization."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $255K TC — $190K base, $150K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. My experience in ad-tech data engineering at scale maps directly to Unity's most critical data infrastructure." Accept at $115K+ RSUs with $175K+ base.
