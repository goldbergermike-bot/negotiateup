**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Unity maintain the infrastructure that builds, tests, and distributes the Unity Engine to millions of developers, powers the Unity Cloud services, runs the Unity Ads network, and supports the internal development workflow for a globally distributed engineering team. Unity's build infrastructure is exceptionally complex — the engine must be compiled and tested across 20+ target platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, PS5, Xbox, Switch, WebGL, VR headsets), each with multiple configurations. The Unity Ads infrastructure processes billions of ad requests daily with strict latency requirements. DevOps engineers at Unity manage a multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP) that serves both the developer-facing products and the ad-tech platform. [Source: Unity Infrastructure 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Unity DevOps (L3-L4) = Google L3-L4 SRE = Amazon L5-L6 SysDE

**Global Levers**

1. **20+ Platform Build Matrix:** "Unity's CI/CD pipeline must compile and test across 20+ platforms with multiple configurations each. This build matrix is among the most complex in software engineering."
2. **Ad-Tech Infrastructure Scale:** "Unity's ads infrastructure processes billions of requests daily. This is ad-tech scale infrastructure with real-time bidding latency requirements."
3. **Multi-Cloud Architecture:** "Unity's infrastructure spans AWS and GCP. DevOps engineers who can optimize across multiple cloud providers have specialized expertise."
4. **Developer Distribution Infrastructure:** "Distributing the Unity Engine to millions of developers requires CDN management, version control, and installation infrastructure at massive scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $250K TC — $188K base, $140K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. Unity's 20+ platform build matrix and ad-tech scale infrastructure require specialized DevOps skills." Accept at $108K+ RSUs with $172K+ base.
