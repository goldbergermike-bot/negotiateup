### Security Engineer | Unity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Post-IPO Comp Stabilizing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Unity protect a platform that ships runtime code to billions of devices worldwide. Unity's security surface is uniquely broad: the Unity Engine runtime (embedded in millions of apps on billions of devices), Unity Cloud services, the Unity Asset Store (marketplace), Unity Ads (ad-tech platform processing sensitive user data), and the development environment itself. Security at Unity involves application security for the engine and editor, supply-chain security for the asset pipeline, ad fraud prevention, cloud security, and ensuring that the runtime doesn't introduce vulnerabilities into customer applications. Post-restructuring, security has become more critical as Unity focuses on enterprise customers (automotive, defense, healthcare) with strict security requirements.

**Level Mapping:** Unity Security Engineer (L3-L4) = Google L4 Security = CrowdStrike Senior Security

**Global Levers**

1. **Runtime Supply-Chain Security:** "Unity's runtime ships inside billions of applications. A vulnerability in the runtime is a vulnerability in every Unity-built app. The supply-chain security implications are enormous."
2. **Enterprise Security Requirements:** "Unity's expansion into automotive, defense, and healthcare requires enterprise-grade security. Security engineers who understand compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP) are essential."
3. **Ad-Tech Privacy & Fraud:** "Unity's advertising platform handles sensitive user data and faces sophisticated ad fraud. Security engineers with ad-tech security experience protect significant revenue."
4. **Asset Store Marketplace Security:** "The Unity Asset Store is a marketplace where developers buy and sell code assets. Ensuring these assets are free of malware and vulnerabilities is a unique security challenge."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $285K TC — $205K base, $160K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. Unity's security surface — billions of runtime installs, ad-tech data, enterprise customers — requires specialized expertise." Accept at $125K+ RSUs with $190K+ base.
