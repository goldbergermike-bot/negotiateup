**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Unity own the product strategy for the world's most widely-used game engine and its expanding portfolio of platform services (ads, analytics, cloud, multiplayer). Unity's PM role is developer-facing — your "customers" are the millions of game developers who build with Unity, making this more of a developer-tools PM role than a consumer PM role. PMs at Unity must deeply understand game development workflows, engine architecture, and the competitive landscape (primarily Unreal Engine and Godot). Unity's post-restructuring strategy has sharpened PM focus on core engine features, runtime performance, and developer experience — divesting non-core areas. PMs who joined during the growth era managed a sprawling product portfolio; PMs joining now have a focused mandate on what matters most. [Source: Unity Product Organization 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Unity PM (L3-L4) = Google L5 PM = Atlassian PM = AWS PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Developer Audience Expertise:** "Unity's customer is the game developer. PMs with game development experience or developer-tools PM experience are rare and valuable — I understand the user because I am the user."
2. **Engine vs. Platform Services:** PMs on core engine have the highest strategic impact: "The core engine is Unity's primary competitive advantage. PM decisions on engine features directly determine market share against Unreal and Godot."
3. **Post-Restructuring Focus:** "Unity's product focus has sharpened. As PM, I'm working with a clear mandate and fewer distractions — this is when PMs have the most impact."
4. **RSU Recovery Opportunity:** "I want a generous RSU grant at current stock prices. If Unity executes its strategy, these RSUs have significant recovery upside."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $300K TC — $210K base, $175K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. My developer-tools PM experience directly maps to Unity's refocused product strategy." Accept at $140K+ RSUs with $195K+ base.
