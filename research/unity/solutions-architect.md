### Solutions Architect | Unity Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** RSU + Bonus / Post-IPO Comp Stabilizing

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $160K–$225K | $70K–$190K | 10% | $210K–$325K |
| Austin | $140K–$200K | $56K–$160K | 10% | $183K–$285K |
| Copenhagen | DKK 500K–DKK 750K | DKK 150K–DKK 310K | 10% | DKK 695K–DKK 1.11M |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Unity design technical solutions for the company's most strategic customers — AAA game studios, enterprise clients (automotive, architecture, film), and platform partners (Apple, Google, Sony, Microsoft). Unity's SA role is customer-facing, requiring deep engine knowledge, cross-platform expertise, and the ability to architect solutions that leverage Unity's full product portfolio (engine, cloud services, ads, analytics, multiplayer). SAs at Unity are particularly valuable for enterprise expansion — automotive companies using Unity for digital twins, film studios using Unity for virtual production, and healthcare companies using Unity for surgical simulation all need SA guidance. This customer-facing SA role differs from internal platform SA roles at pure gaming companies. [Source: Unity Enterprise, Customer Engineering 2025]

**Level Mapping:** Unity SA (L4) = Google L4-L5 Solutions = AWS Solutions Architect III-IV

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Customer Expansion:** "Unity's enterprise strategy (automotive, film, healthcare, defense) requires SAs who can translate game engine capabilities into enterprise solutions. This cross-industry SA work is specialized and valuable."
2. **Customer-Facing Revenue Impact:** "As a customer-facing SA, I directly influence deal size and customer retention for Unity's most strategic accounts. A single enterprise deal can be worth millions in annual revenue."
3. **Cross-Platform Expertise:** "Unity targets 20+ platforms. SAs who can architect solutions that leverage Unity's cross-platform capabilities for specific customer requirements are essential."
4. **Post-Restructuring Customer Trust:** "Post-restructuring, customer trust needs rebuilding. SAs who can maintain and strengthen relationships with key accounts are protecting Unity's revenue base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $300K TC — $215K base, $170K RSU/4yr, and 10% bonus. My SA experience with [enterprise/gaming/cross-platform] customers directly maps to Unity's most strategic customer relationships." Accept at $135K+ RSUs with $200K+ base.
