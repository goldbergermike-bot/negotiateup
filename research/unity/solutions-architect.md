**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Unity design technical solutions for the company's most strategic customers — AAA game studios, enterprise clients (automotive, architecture, film), and platform partners (Apple, Google, Sony, Microsoft). Unity's SA role is customer-facing, requiring deep engine knowledge, cross-platform expertise, and the ability to architect solutions that leverage Unity's full product portfolio (engine, cloud services, ads, analytics, multiplayer). SAs at Unity are particularly valuable for enterprise expansion — automotive companies using Unity for digital twins, film studios using Unity for virtual production, and healthcare companies using Unity for surgical simulation all need SA guidance. This customer-facing SA role differs from internal platform SA roles at pure gaming companies. [Source: Unity Enterprise, Customer Engineering 2025]
