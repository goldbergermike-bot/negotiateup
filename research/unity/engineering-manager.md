**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Unity lead teams rebuilding the world's most widely-used game engine. Post-restructuring, Unity EMs manage leaner teams with increased scope — the EM role has become more demanding as each team is expected to deliver more with fewer engineers. EMs at Unity are technically strong (most transitioned from Senior/Staff IC roles) and are expected to contribute to architecture discussions while managing people and delivery. Unity's distributed workforce means EMs often manage across SF, Austin, Montreal, and Copenhagen — requiring strong asynchronous management skills. EMs on the engine/runtime team, editor team, or platform services team have the highest strategic impact. The EM role at Unity is also challenging because of the need to rebuild team morale and trust after multiple rounds of layoffs. [Source: Unity EM Framework 2025]

**Global Levers**

1. **Post-Restructuring Leadership Premium:** "Managing a team post-layoffs requires exceptional leadership — rebuilding morale, retaining remaining talent, and maintaining velocity during organizational uncertainty. This is harder than managing during growth."
2. **Distributed Team Management:** "Unity's engineering org spans SF, Austin, Montreal, and Copenhagen. Managing a distributed team across multiple time zones requires communication skills that justify a premium."
3. **Strategic Rebuild Impact:** "EMs joining Unity now are leading the strategic rebuild. My team's delivery directly determines whether Unity's refocus on core engine technology succeeds."
4. **RSU Recovery Upside:** "EM-level RSU grants at current stock prices represent significant recovery upside. I want a generous RSU grant — $280K+ over 4 years."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $405K TC — $255K base, $290K RSU/4yr, and 15% bonus. Managing during Unity's rebuilding phase requires both technical depth and exceptional leadership. My experience leading teams through [similar transitions] directly transfers." Accept at $240K+ RSUs with $240K+ base.
