### Product Designer | Lucid Motors Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive but Volatile Equity (LCID) | Luxury EV Leader | Saudi Backing | Bay Area Location

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Newark CA (HQ) | $125K-$175K | $45K-$140K | 10% | $147K-$232K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Product Designers shape the luxury EV experience — from the vehicle's glass cockpit display to the Lucid app to the premium retail experience. Designing for a luxury EV means every interaction must meet the refinement standards of Mercedes and BMW while pushing the boundaries of what a software-defined vehicle can offer. Lucid's design language is minimalist and tech-forward, requiring designers who can balance luxury aesthetics with complex information architecture for vehicle HMI. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid Product Design Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Lucid Product Designer = Google UX Designer L3-L4 = Tesla Product Designer = Apple Design = Rivian Product Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Luxury HMI Design:** "Designing the HMI for a luxury EV competing with Mercedes and BMW requires a level of refinement and attention to detail that exceeds standard product design."
2. **Glass Cockpit Interface:** "Lucid's 34-inch glass cockpit display is one of the most advanced in-vehicle interfaces in production. Designing for this unique form factor is specialized work."
3. **Physical + Digital Luxury:** "I design across physical (vehicle interior, retail) and digital (app, HMI) touchpoints, all at luxury quality standards."
4. **Bay Area Design Market:** "Product designers in the Bay Area have strong alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Designing the luxury EV experience for Lucid's glass cockpit and digital ecosystem is unique. I'm targeting $125K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $170K. I have a Google design offer at $[X]." Accept at $105K+ RSUs with base above $162K.
