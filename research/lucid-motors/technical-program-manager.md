**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Technical Program Managers coordinate complex programs across luxury EV development — vehicle software, powertrain integration, manufacturing, and connected services. TPMs at Lucid manage programs that span hardware-software integration with luxury quality requirements. A single vehicle feature may require coordination across embedded software, cloud services, manufacturing changes, and supplier certification — all meeting the refinement standards of a luxury vehicle. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid TPM Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Lucid TPM = Google TPM L4-L5 = Tesla TPM = Rivian TPM = Amazon TPM

**Global Levers**

1. **Luxury Vehicle Program Complexity:** "Lucid programs must meet luxury quality standards across hardware and software — a dual mandate that exceeds typical software TPM roles."
2. **Hardware-Software Coordination:** "I coordinate across embedded vehicle software, cloud services, manufacturing, and supply chain. This cross-domain complexity is unique to automotive."
3. **LCID Equity Hedge:** "LCID equity risk means the RSU grant needs to be sized generously: $160K+ over 4 years."
4. **Bay Area TPM Market:** "TPMs in the Bay Area have strong alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Lucid's program complexity spans vehicle software, manufacturing, and luxury quality standards. I'm targeting $160K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a Google TPM offer at $[X]." Accept at $140K+ RSUs with base above $180K.
