| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Solutions Architects design the system architectures connecting Lucid's vehicle platform, cloud services, charging network, and partner integrations. As Lucid scales, Solutions Architects define how external systems (charging networks, service providers, insurance, financing) integrate with Lucid's luxury EV ecosystem. Your architectures must meet luxury-grade reliability standards while supporting rapid scaling. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid Solutions Architecture Comp 2026]
