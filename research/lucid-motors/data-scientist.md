### Data Scientist | Lucid Motors Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive but Volatile Equity (LCID) | Luxury EV Leader | Saudi Backing | Bay Area Location

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Newark CA (HQ) | $140K-$195K | $60K-$175K | 10% | $170K-$280K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Data Scientists analyze vehicle performance, battery degradation, customer behavior, and manufacturing quality for the most technologically advanced EV in production. Your analyses directly inform product improvements — identifying battery optimization opportunities, predicting maintenance needs, and understanding how luxury EV customers use their vehicles. Lucid's unique dataset combines vehicle telemetry from the most efficient EV powertrain with luxury customer behavior. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid Data Science Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Lucid Data Scientist = Google DS L3-L4 = Tesla Data Scientist = Amazon Applied Scientist = Meta Data Scientist (IC3-IC4)

**Global Levers**

1. **Unique Powertrain Dataset:** "Lucid's powertrain generates the most detailed efficiency data in the EV industry. My analyses of this data drive OTA updates that improve range and performance across the fleet."
2. **Luxury Customer Analytics:** "Understanding luxury EV customer behavior requires specialized analytical approaches that differ from mass-market automotive analytics."
3. **LCID Equity Hedge:** "LCID equity risk means the grant needs to be sized generously: $155K+ over 4 years."
4. **Bay Area DS Market:** "Data scientists in the Bay Area have strong alternatives. Lucid needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Lucid's data science spans vehicle performance, battery optimization, and luxury customer analytics. I'm targeting $155K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a Google DS offer at $[X]." Accept at $135K+ RSUs with base above $180K.
