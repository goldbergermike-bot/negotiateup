### Security Engineer | Lucid Motors Global Negotiation Guide

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Security Engineers protect luxury EVs, customer data, manufacturing systems, and cloud infrastructure. Security for a luxury EV manufacturer has unique stakes — affluent customers expect premium data protection, vehicle cybersecurity protects physical safety, and brand reputation is paramount. Lucid's security scope spans vehicle cybersecurity, connected vehicle services, customer data (including financial and location data), manufacturing OT, and supply chain security. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid Security Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Lucid Security Engineer = Google Security Engineer L3-L4 = Tesla Security Engineer = Rivian Security Engineer = Amazon Security Engineer

**Global Levers**

1. **Luxury Vehicle Cybersecurity:** "Luxury vehicle customers expect premium security. A cybersecurity incident at Lucid would disproportionately damage brand reputation given the premium positioning."
2. **Vehicle + Cloud Security:** "I secure both vehicle systems and cloud infrastructure — a dual-domain security expertise that is rare and commands a premium."
3. **LCID Equity Hedge:** "LCID equity risk means the RSU grant needs to be sized generously: $160K+ over 4 years."
4. **Bay Area Security Market:** "Security engineers in the Bay Area have strong alternatives."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Lucid's security spans luxury vehicle cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure. I'm targeting $160K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $190K. I have a Google Security offer at $[X]." Accept at $140K+ RSUs with base above $180K.
