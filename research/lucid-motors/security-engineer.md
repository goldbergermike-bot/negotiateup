Lucid Security Engineers protect luxury EVs, customer data, manufacturing systems, and cloud infrastructure. Security for a luxury EV manufacturer has unique stakes — affluent customers expect premium data protection, vehicle cybersecurity protects physical safety, and brand reputation is paramount. Lucid's security scope spans vehicle cybersecurity, connected vehicle services, customer data (including financial and location data), manufacturing OT, and supply chain security. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid Security Engineering Comp 2026]
