**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Product Managers define the product strategy for the luxury EV experience — connected vehicle features, ADAS capabilities, charging experience, and the digital ecosystem. PMs at Lucid must balance luxury customer expectations (refined, premium, seamless) with the constraints of a scaling EV manufacturer. Your product decisions directly shape how Lucid competes with Tesla, Mercedes, and BMW in the luxury EV segment. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid PM Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Lucid Product Manager = Google PM L4-L5 = Tesla PM = Amazon PM = Meta PM (IC4-IC5)

2. **Software-Defined Vehicle Strategy:** "Lucid's vehicles are software-defined — features unlock and improve via OTA updates. I own the product strategy for a vehicle that gets better over time."
3. **LCID Equity Hedge:** "LCID equity risk means the grant needs to be sized generously: $170K+ over 4 years."
4. **Bay Area PM Market:** "PMs in the Bay Area have strong alternatives. Lucid needs to be competitive."
