**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid Engineering Managers lead teams building software for the most technologically advanced luxury EV in production. You must recruit and retain engineering talent in the Bay Area while maintaining the quality standards expected of a luxury vehicle manufacturer. Lucid EMs bridge automotive engineering rigor with Silicon Valley speed, building teams that can deliver both. LCID equity at EM level is substantial but carries volatility risk. Saudi PIF backing provides organizational stability. [Source: Lucid EM Comp 2026]
