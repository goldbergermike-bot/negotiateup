### ML/AI Engineer | Lucid Motors Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive but Volatile Equity (LCID) | Luxury EV Leader | **+5-10% ML PREMIUM** | Saudi Backing | Bay Area Location

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Newark CA (HQ) | $148K-$208K | $70K-$200K | 10% | $185K-$305K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Lucid ML/AI Engineers build machine learning models for ADAS features, battery optimization, predictive maintenance, and personalized vehicle experiences. ML at Lucid applies to both the driving experience (computer vision, driver assistance) and the powertrain (battery degradation prediction, efficiency optimization, charging intelligence). The 5-10% ML premium reflects the scarcity of ML engineers with automotive and EV domain expertise. LCID equity carries volatility risk. [Source: Lucid ML Engineering Comp 2026]

**Level Mapping:** Lucid ML/AI Engineer = Google ML Engineer L3-L4 = Tesla ML Engineer = Rivian ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist

**Global Levers**

1. **Powertrain ML Optimization:** "My ML models optimize the most efficient EV powertrain in production. Battery degradation prediction, charging optimization, and efficiency modeling directly impact vehicle range and longevity."
2. **ADAS ML for Luxury Vehicles:** "ADAS features for luxury vehicles must meet higher refinement standards — smooth, confident, and predictable. My ML models must deliver a premium driving experience."
3. **LCID Equity Hedge:** "LCID equity risk means the grant needs to be sized generously: $180K+ over 4 years."
4. **ML Talent Competition:** "ML engineers in the Bay Area have offers from Google, Tesla, and top AI labs. Lucid needs to compete."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Lucid's ML challenges span powertrain optimization and ADAS for the most advanced luxury EV. I'm targeting $180K in RSUs over 4 years and a base of $203K. I have a Google ML offer at $[X]." Accept at $155K+ RSUs with base above $193K.
