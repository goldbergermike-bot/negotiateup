### Product Designer | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $185K–$232K | $215K–$378K | — | $239K–$326K |
| Seattle | $178K–$225K | $215K–$378K | — | $232K–$320K |
| London | £128K–£162K | £158K–£275K | — | £168K–£231K |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Product Designers create the interfaces for the world's most transformative AI products. You design ChatGPT's conversation UX — the interaction paradigm that 200M+ weekly users engage with — plus the API developer experience, the GPT Store, multimodal interfaces, and enterprise dashboards. This is the most influential design role in tech: you're inventing the design patterns for how humans communicate with AI, patterns that every other company copies.

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a Product Designer, the No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs start vesting immediately — I don't wait 12 months like at Google or Meta. At the designer level, that cliff period represents $55K-$95K in foregone equity. OpenAI's Day-1 vesting is a tangible financial advantage that should be factored into every offer comparison. The design role shapes how 200M+ users interact with AI, and the equity should vest from Day 1 to reflect that impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **Inventing AI Interaction Design:** "I design the conversation UX for ChatGPT — the interaction paradigm that 200M+ people use weekly and every competitor copies. I'm not just designing a product; I'm inventing the design language for human-AI interaction."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $55K-$95K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff at competitors. My PPUs start from Day 1."
3. **200M+ User Impact:** "My design decisions directly impact 200M+ weekly active users. Very few design roles in the world touch this many users with this much influence on behavior."
4. **PPU Upside — Design-Led Differentiation:** "ChatGPT's design is a core differentiator vs Claude and Gemini. My design work directly drives user retention and revenue growth, which drives PPU value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $228K base and $372K PPUs over 4 years for this Product Designer role. I design the conversation UX for 200M+ weekly users — inventing the design patterns for human-AI interaction that every competitor copies. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $55K-$95K in equity I'd earn in Year 1 that I'd forfeit at a cliff competitor. I have competing design offers from [Google at $310K TC / Anthropic at $325K TC]. OpenAI's design influence and PPU upside are unique." Accept at $212K+ base and $335K+ PPUs.
