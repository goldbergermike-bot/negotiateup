| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI TPMs coordinate the most consequential program management in AI — orchestrating model releases (GPT-5), product launches (ChatGPT features), safety review processes, enterprise rollouts, and the cross-functional coordination between research, engineering, product, and policy teams. At OpenAI, every release carries world-level impact: a GPT model launch reshapes entire industries, a safety evaluation determines responsible deployment, and an enterprise feature rollout unlocks millions in revenue. TPMs are the connective tissue that makes this happen on schedule. [Source: OpenAI TPM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** OpenAI TPM = Google L4-L5 TPM = Meta IC4-IC5 TPM = Anthropic TPM

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a TPM, I coordinate programs that generate immediate revenue and user impact. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs reflect that from Day 1 — I don't wait 12 months while shipping world-changing products. A cliff at Google or Meta costs $60K-$108K in foregone equity. OpenAI's immediate vesting structure means higher true Year 1 take-home."

**Global Levers**

1. **World-Impact Program Coordination:** "I coordinate model releases and product launches that reshape industries. Every GPT release I manage impacts 200M+ users and thousands of enterprise customers. This is the highest-stakes program management in tech."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "I ship world-changing products from Day 1. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $60K-$108K in equity that competitors withhold during a cliff period."
3. **Cross-Functional Orchestration:** "I coordinate across research, engineering, product, safety, and policy — the most complex cross-functional landscape in AI. Model releases require alignment across teams that don't exist at other companies."
4. **Safety Review Process Management:** "I manage the safety evaluation and responsible deployment processes for frontier models. These processes determine whether the world's most capable AI is deployed responsibly."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $242K base and $422K PPUs over 4 years for this TPM role. I coordinate model releases and product launches at the world's defining AI company — programs that impact 200M+ users and reshape industries. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $60K-$108K in equity competitors withhold. I have competing TPM offers from [Google at $340K TC / Meta at $348K TC]. OpenAI's program scope and PPU upside are unmatched." Accept at $222K+ base and $378K+ PPUs.
