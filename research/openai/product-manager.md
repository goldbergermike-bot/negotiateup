**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Product Managers define the product strategy for AI products used by 200M+ weekly active users. This is the most consequential PM role in tech: your product decisions shape how humanity interacts with AI — from ChatGPT's conversation UX to enterprise API features to multimodal capabilities to the GPT Store ecosystem. PMs at OpenAI work at the intersection of frontier AI research and mass-market product design, translating model capabilities into products that billions of people use.

**Level Mapping:** OpenAI PM = Google L4-L5 PM = Meta IC5 PM = Anthropic PM

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a Product Manager, OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs — the equity tied to the most valuable AI company in the world — start vesting immediately. At Google or Meta, I'd wait 12 months before seeing any equity. That cliff period costs $80K-$145K in foregone equity at the PM level. OpenAI's Day-1 vesting is the equivalent of a large signing bonus that competitors don't offer. Factor this into every offer comparison."

**Global Levers**

1. **Most Consequential PM Role in Tech:** "I define product strategy for AI products used by 200M+ people weekly. My product decisions shape how humanity interacts with AI — that's the highest-impact PM role in the industry."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $80K-$145K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff at Google or Meta. My PPUs start earning from Day 1."
3. **AI-Native Product Innovation:** "I work at the intersection of frontier AI research and mass-market product design. Every model capability I translate into a product feature reaches more users than any other PM role in AI."
4. **PPU Upside — Product-Led Growth:** "OpenAI's revenue growth is product-led — ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise, API. My product decisions directly drive the revenue that makes PPUs valuable. The better my products perform, the more my equity is worth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $268K base and $562K PPUs over 4 years for this Product Manager role. I define product strategy for the most consequential AI platform in history — 200M+ weekly users — and OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $80K-$145K in equity I'd forfeit at a cliff-based competitor. I have competing PM offers from [Google at $400K TC / Anthropic at $420K TC with higher base]. OpenAI's product-led growth and PPU upside are unique, but the equity must reflect PM-level impact on the world's most important AI products." Accept at $245K+ base and $498K+ PPUs.
