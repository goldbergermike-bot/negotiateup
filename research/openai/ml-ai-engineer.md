### ML/AI Engineer | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+) | **+25–40% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $265K–$335K | $500K–$900K | — | $390K–$560K |
| Seattle | $255K–$325K | $500K–$900K | — | $380K–$550K |
| London | £185K–£235K | £365K–£658K | — | £276K–£400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI ML/AI Engineers are at the absolute frontier of artificial intelligence — training and optimizing the world's most capable AI models, building the infrastructure for GPT-5 and beyond, developing multimodal capabilities, and creating the systems that push the boundaries of what AI can do. This is the most sought-after ML role in the world: you work with more compute, better data, and more advanced model architectures than any other company. The Agentic AI Premium (25-40%) applies to engineers building autonomous agent capabilities — tool use, code execution, multi-step reasoning, and the agent frameworks that enable GPTs and Assistants to take actions in the real world.

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As an ML/AI Engineer at the frontier, my contributions to model training and capabilities begin immediately. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs — potentially $500K-$900K over 4 years — start vesting from my first month. At Google or DeepMind, I'd wait 12 months before seeing any equity, forgoing $125K-$225K. For ML roles where every researcher is being recruited by every AI lab simultaneously, No-Cliff vesting is a decisive advantage."

**Global Levers**

1. **Frontier Model Training:** "I train and optimize the world's most capable AI models — GPT-5 and beyond. More compute, better data, more advanced architectures than any other lab. This is the pinnacle of ML engineering."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — ML Premium:** "ML engineers are the most recruited talent in tech. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $125K-$225K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff at Google, DeepMind, or Meta FAIR."
3. **Agentic AI Premium (25-40%):** "I build the autonomous agent capabilities — tool use, code execution, multi-step reasoning — that enable GPTs and Assistants to act in the real world. This is the purest form of agentic AI, and it commands a 25-40% premium."
4. **PPU Upside — ML-Driven Valuation:** "OpenAI's valuation is fundamentally driven by model capabilities — my work. Every capability improvement I ship directly increases the value of my PPU grants. No other equity is this directly tied to ML engineering output."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $328K base and $880K PPUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer role with the 25-40% Agentic AI Premium. I train and optimize frontier models at the world's most advanced AI lab, and I build the agentic capabilities that define OpenAI's next chapter. No-Cliff vesting means $125K-$225K in equity I'd forfeit at a cliff competitor. I have competing ML offers from [Google Brain at $520K TC / Anthropic at $525K TC with $335K base / DeepMind at $510K TC]. OpenAI's compute advantage and PPU upside are unmatched, but the grant must reflect frontier ML contribution with the Agentic AI Premium." Accept at $298K+ base and $800K+ PPUs.
