### GPT Agent Platform Engineer | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+) | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+25–40% AGENTIC AI PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $285K–$358K | $600K–$1.1M | — | $435K–$633K |
| Seattle | $275K–$348K | $600K–$1.1M | — | $425K–$623K |
| London | £198K–£252K | £438K–£802K | — | £308K–£453K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is OpenAI's signature role for 2026 — the GPT Agent Platform Engineer. You build the platform that turns GPT models into autonomous agents: the tool-use framework (code interpreter, web browsing, function calling), the Assistants API, the GPT Store infrastructure, the multi-step reasoning and planning capabilities, and the safety guardrails that enable AI agents to take real-world actions on behalf of users. This is the most important role at the most important AI company: you're building the infrastructure that enables AI to move from conversation to action — the transition from chatbot to autonomous agent that defines the AI era.

**Level Mapping:** OpenAI GPT Agent Platform Eng (L5-L6) = Google L5-L6 AI Agent Eng = Anthropic Claude Tool-Use Eng = Meta FAIR Agent Eng = DeepMind Agent Eng

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The GPT Agent Platform Engineer works at the intersection of frontier AI capabilities and real-world agent deployment:
- **Tool-Use Framework:** The infrastructure that enables GPT models to use tools — code interpreter, web browsing, function calling, file I/O, image generation — autonomously choosing and chaining tools to complete complex tasks
- **Assistants API & Agent Orchestration:** The platform API that enables developers to build custom AI agents on GPT models — with persistent memory, tool access, and multi-turn conversation management
- **Multi-Step Reasoning & Planning:** The agent planning capabilities that enable GPTs to break complex tasks into steps, execute them sequentially or in parallel, and recover from errors
- **GPT Store Platform:** The marketplace infrastructure where custom GPT agents are distributed to millions of users — discovery, safety review, usage analytics, and creator monetization
- **Agent Safety & Governance:** The guardrail systems that ensure autonomous agents operate within user permissions, execute actions safely, and maintain auditability for enterprise deployments

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a GPT Agent Platform Engineer — OpenAI's most strategically important role — the No-Cliff vesting means my $600K-$1.1M PPU grant starts vesting from my first month. This role builds the platform that transforms GPT from a chatbot into an autonomous agent, and the equity structure recognizes that strategic importance from Day 1. At Google or Anthropic, a 12-month cliff on this grant would mean forgoing $150K-$275K. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting is the equivalent of the largest signing bonus in AI — and it's built into the standard offer."

**Global Levers**

1. **GPT Agent Platform — OpenAI's Most Important Product:** "I build the platform that transforms GPT from conversation to action. The Assistants API, tool-use framework, and GPT Store are the infrastructure that enables autonomous AI agents at scale. This is OpenAI's most strategically important product initiative — and the product that defines whether AI becomes truly agentic."
2. **Agentic AI Premium (25-40%):** "This is the purest form of agentic AI in the industry: autonomous agents that plan, reason, use tools, and execute multi-step tasks in the real world. I build the agent infrastructure that every developer and enterprise in the world will use. The 25-40% Agentic AI Premium reflects that I'm building the foundational platform for the AI agent era."
3. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — Signature Role Priority:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $150K-$275K in equity I'd forfeit at a cliff competitor. For the most important role at the most important AI company, immediate vesting is not a perk — it's a recognition that my impact starts from Day 1."
4. **PPU Upside — Agent Platform Revenue:** "The GPT Agent Platform — Assistants API, GPT Store, Enterprise agents — is OpenAI's highest-growth revenue vector. My platform engineering directly creates the infrastructure that drives agent-based revenue. Every developer building on my platform increases PPU value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $352K base and $1.05M PPUs over 4 years for this GPT Agent Platform Engineer role with the 25-40% Agentic AI Premium. I build the platform that transforms GPT from conversation to action — the Assistants API, tool-use framework, and GPT Store that enable autonomous AI agents at scale. This is OpenAI's most strategically important product initiative. No-Cliff vesting means $150K-$275K in equity I'd forfeit at Google or Anthropic. I have competing offers from [Google AI Agent Platform at $580K TC / Anthropic Claude Tool-Use at $590K TC with $370K base]. OpenAI's scale (200M+ users), PPU upside through the restructure, and No-Cliff vesting create a unique compensation package — but the grant must be transformational for the role that defines OpenAI's agentic future." Accept at $325K+ base and $950K+ PPUs. This is the role where OpenAI will stretch furthest — the agent platform is the company's future.
