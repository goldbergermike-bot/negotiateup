### Senior Software Engineer | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $225K–$285K | $400K–$700K | — | $325K–$460K |
| Seattle | $218K–$275K | $400K–$700K | — | $318K–$450K |
| London | £155K–£198K | £290K–£510K | — | £228K–£325K |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Senior Software Engineers own critical systems within the platform — from ChatGPT's serving infrastructure to API gateway architecture to model deployment pipelines that serve billions of requests daily. At this level, you're making architecture decisions that directly impact the reliability, performance, and cost of the world's most-used AI platform. OpenAI's equity-heavy comp through PPUs carries massive upside, and the December 2025 cliff elimination means your equity starts vesting on Day 1. [Source: OpenAI Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1 — no more waiting 12 months for your first equity tranche. This is a massive liquidity advantage over competitors who still impose cliffs. "At the senior level, a 1-year cliff at a competitor means forgoing $100K-$175K in equity during that period. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means I earn equity from month one. When Google offers $450K TC but with a cliff, my actual Year 1 cash is significantly lower than OpenAI's No-Cliff structure. Calculate the true Year 1 take-home — OpenAI's Day-1 vesting wins on real liquidity."

**Global Levers**

1. **Frontier AI Infrastructure Ownership:** "As a Senior SWE, I own critical systems serving billions of API requests daily. My architecture decisions directly impact OpenAI's revenue — every millisecond of latency and every nine of uptime translates to enterprise customer retention."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $100K-$175K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff period at Google or Meta. My PPUs start vesting from Day 1 — that's real money in Year 1."
3. **PPU Upside — $300B+ Trajectory:** "OpenAI's PPUs are priced at current valuation with exposure to the for-profit restructure. At the senior level, my $700K PPU grant could be worth multiples at a $300B+ valuation."
4. **ChatGPT + API Dual Platform:** "I build infrastructure that serves both the world's largest consumer AI product (ChatGPT) and the enterprise API platform. This dual platform exposure is unique to OpenAI."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $278K base and $685K PPUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer role. I own critical infrastructure systems at the world's defining AI company, and OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means I earn $175K+ in equity during Year 1 that I'd forfeit at a cliff-based competitor. I have competing offers from [Google L5 at $450K TC / Anthropic at $465K TC with $315K base]. OpenAI's PPU upside and No-Cliff structure are compelling, but the grant must reflect senior-level ownership of mission-critical systems." Accept at $255K+ base and $625K+ PPUs.
