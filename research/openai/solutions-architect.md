### Solutions Architect | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $205K–$255K | $275K–$478K | — | $274K–$375K |
| Seattle | $198K–$248K | $275K–$478K | — | $267K–$368K |
| London | £142K–£178K | £200K–£348K | — | £192K–£265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Solutions Architects are the technical bridge between the world's most advanced AI platform and the enterprises deploying it. You design API integration architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and deployment patterns for Fortune 500 companies, governments, and high-growth startups building on OpenAI's platform. This is the most consequential SA role in AI: your architecture decisions determine how enterprises adopt and scale AI capabilities that are reshaping every industry. OpenAI's enterprise revenue growth depends on SAs enabling successful deployments. [Source: OpenAI SA Comp 2025-2026]

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a Solutions Architect, I drive enterprise adoption and revenue from my first customer engagement. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs reflect that immediate revenue impact — I don't wait 12 months while delivering value from Day 1. A cliff at competitors costs $70K-$120K in foregone equity. When comparing SA offers, OpenAI's No-Cliff structure means higher true Year 1 compensation."

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise AI Deployment at Scale:** "I architect AI deployments for the world's largest enterprises on the most advanced AI platform. My integration designs determine how Fortune 500 companies adopt AI — the most consequential SA role in the industry."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "I deliver enterprise revenue from my first engagement. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs vest from Day 1, matching my immediate revenue contribution."
3. **API Platform Revenue Growth:** "OpenAI's enterprise API revenue is growing exponentially. My architecture decisions — fine-tuning strategies, deployment patterns, integration designs — directly drive platform adoption and revenue."
4. **PPU Upside — Enterprise-Led Growth:** "Enterprise revenue is OpenAI's highest-margin growth driver. As an SA enabling that growth, my work directly increases the value of PPU grants."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $250K base and $468K PPUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect role. I drive enterprise AI adoption on the world's most advanced platform — my architecture decisions directly fuel OpenAI's revenue growth. No-Cliff vesting means $70K-$120K in Year 1 equity competitors withhold. I have competing SA offers from [Google Cloud at $362K TC / AWS at $348K TC]. OpenAI's enterprise growth trajectory and PPU upside are unique." Accept at $232K+ base and $418K+ PPUs.
