**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Data Scientists analyze the most consequential AI datasets in the world — user interaction data from 200M+ weekly ChatGPT users, model performance metrics across GPT-5 capabilities, safety evaluation data, and the business analytics that drive OpenAI's revenue growth. You work with data that no other company has: the world's largest dataset of human-AI conversations, providing insights into how people use AI that shape both product decisions and model training priorities.

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a Data Scientist, I work with the world's most valuable AI interaction dataset. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs — tied to the company best positioned to monetize AI — start vesting immediately. A 12-month cliff at Google or Meta costs $70K-$125K in foregone equity. OpenAI's Day-1 structure is worth real money in Year 1."

**Global Levers**

1. **World's Largest Human-AI Dataset:** "I analyze 200M+ weekly users' AI interactions — the largest human-AI conversation dataset in existence. My insights shape both product decisions and model training priorities. No other company has this data."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $70K-$125K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff at competitors. My PPUs start from Day 1."
3. **Model Evaluation & Safety Metrics:** "I define the metrics that determine whether GPT-5 is safe and capable enough to deploy. My evaluation frameworks directly impact the most consequential AI deployment decisions in the world."
4. **Revenue Analytics — Product-Led Growth:** "OpenAI's revenue growth is driven by data-informed product decisions. My analytics directly inform pricing, feature prioritization, and enterprise strategy for the fastest-growing AI business."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $252K base and $488K PPUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist role. I analyze the world's largest human-AI interaction dataset — 200M+ weekly users — and my insights shape both product strategy and model training. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $70K-$125K in equity I'd earn in Year 1 that competitors withhold. I have competing DS offers from [Google at $355K TC / Meta at $365K TC]. OpenAI's unique dataset and PPU upside are compelling." Accept at $232K+ base and $438K+ PPUs.
