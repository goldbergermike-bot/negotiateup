**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Engineering Managers lead teams building the infrastructure, products, and models that define the AI era. You manage 6-15 engineers working on ChatGPT features, API platform reliability, model training infrastructure, or safety systems — and your hiring, retention, and delivery decisions directly shape OpenAI's ability to maintain its frontier position. EM roles at OpenAI carry unique weight: you're building and scaling the engineering org at the fastest-growing AI company in history, recruiting against every Big Tech company and AI lab simultaneously.

**Level Mapping:** OpenAI EM = Google L5-L6 EM = Meta M1-M2 = Anthropic EM

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As an Engineering Manager, the No-Cliff vesting is a critical recruitment tool and a personal financial advantage. I can tell candidates that OpenAI doesn't hold their equity hostage for 12 months — and I benefit from the same policy. At the EM level, a cliff at Google or Meta means forgoing $125K-$220K in equity during Year 1. OpenAI's Day-1 vesting eliminates that dead zone entirely. When comparing EM offers, calculate the true Year 1 cash — OpenAI's No-Cliff structure often exceeds higher-TC offers that impose cliffs."

**Global Levers**

1. **Building the AI Era's Engineering Org:** "I build and lead engineering teams at the company defining the AI era. My hiring decisions, team culture, and delivery execution directly impact whether OpenAI maintains its frontier position against Google, Anthropic, and Meta."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — Recruitment Leverage:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting is both a personal financial advantage ($125K-$220K in Year 1 equity) and a recruitment tool. I can attract top talent by offering immediate equity vesting that competitors can't match."
3. **PPU Upside — EM-Level Grants:** "EM-level PPU grants of $500K-$875K carry massive upside through the for-profit restructure. My leadership directly impacts OpenAI's ability to execute on the most valuable equity opportunity in AI."
4. **Hypergrowth Team Scaling:** "OpenAI is scaling engineering faster than any company in history. My ability to build, retain, and scale high-performing teams in a hypercompetitive talent market is the highest-leverage management role in tech."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $325K base and $850K PPUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager role. I build and lead engineering teams at the world's defining AI company, and my hiring and retention decisions directly impact OpenAI's frontier position. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $125K-$220K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff at Google or Meta. I have competing EM offers from [Google L5 EM at $520K TC / Meta M1 at $540K TC]. OpenAI's PPU upside and No-Cliff structure are compelling, but the grant must reflect EM-level impact on the most important AI company in the world." Accept at $298K+ base and $775K+ PPUs.
