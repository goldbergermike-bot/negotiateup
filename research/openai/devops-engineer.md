### DevOps Engineer | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $200K–$248K | $265K–$462K | — | $266K–$364K |
| Seattle | $192K–$242K | $265K–$462K | — | $258K–$358K |
| London | £138K–£175K | £192K–£338K | — | £186K–£260K |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI DevOps Engineers manage the most demanding AI infrastructure in the world — GPU superclusters training frontier models, inference infrastructure serving billions of ChatGPT and API requests daily, and the deployment pipelines that roll out new model versions to 200M+ users. This is infrastructure engineering at the highest stakes: every minute of downtime impacts millions of users and enterprise customers, and every efficiency improvement in GPU utilization saves millions in compute costs. OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft Azure adds complexity — you operate across proprietary and Azure infrastructure. [Source: OpenAI DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** OpenAI DevOps Eng = Google L4 SRE = Meta Production Eng = Anthropic Infra Eng

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a DevOps Engineer managing the world's most demanding AI infrastructure, my impact is immediate — and OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my compensation reflects that from Day 1. A cliff at Google or Meta costs $65K-$115K in foregone equity during Year 1. OpenAI's immediate vesting means I'm earning equity from my first month of keeping the world's most important AI platform running."

**Global Levers**

1. **World's Most Demanding AI Infrastructure:** "I manage GPU superclusters and inference infrastructure serving billions of requests daily. OpenAI's infrastructure is the most complex and highest-stakes in AI — training frontier models and serving 200M+ users simultaneously."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $65K-$115K in equity I'd forfeit during a cliff at competitors. My infrastructure impact is immediate, and my compensation should be too."
3. **GPU Efficiency = Revenue:** "Every percentage point of GPU utilization improvement saves OpenAI millions in compute costs. My infrastructure optimization directly impacts the bottom line — and therefore PPU value."
4. **Azure Partnership Complexity:** "I operate across OpenAI's proprietary infrastructure and Microsoft Azure — a dual-infrastructure model that requires unique DevOps expertise. This complexity commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $452K PPUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer role. I manage the most demanding AI infrastructure in the world — GPU superclusters and inference systems serving billions of daily requests. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $65K-$115K in equity I'd earn in Year 1 that competitors withhold. I have competing infra offers from [Google SRE at $345K TC / Meta Production at $352K TC]. OpenAI's infrastructure scale and PPU upside are unique." Accept at $225K+ base and $405K+ PPUs.
