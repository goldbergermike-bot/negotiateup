**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Software Engineers build the infrastructure behind the world's most advanced AI systems — GPT-5, DALL-E, Codex, and the ChatGPT platform serving 200M+ weekly active users. OpenAI is the defining AI company of the decade, and every engineer contributes to products that are reshaping how humanity interacts with technology. The comp structure is equity-heavy through Profit Participation Units (PPUs), with the transformative change in December 2025: OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff, meaning new hires begin vesting immediately on Day 1.

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1 — no more waiting 12 months for your first equity tranche. This is a massive liquidity advantage over competitors who still impose cliffs. "OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means I start earning equity from my first month. At Google or Meta, I'd wait a full year before seeing any equity vest. That's $60K-$100K+ in equity I'd be forgoing during a cliff period at a competitor. OpenAI's Day-1 vesting is worth real money — factor it into any offer comparison. When a competitor offers a higher total package but with a 1-year cliff, calculate the true Year 1 cash: OpenAI's No-Cliff structure often wins on actual take-home in the first 12 months."

**Global Levers**

1. **Frontier AI — The Defining Company:** "I build software at the company that defined the AI era. OpenAI's products — GPT, ChatGPT, DALL-E, Codex — are used by 200M+ people weekly. No other company has this combination of technical frontier and consumer scale."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "OpenAI eliminated the vesting cliff in Dec 2025. My equity starts vesting from Day 1 — while competitors make me wait 12 months. That's real liquidity worth $60K-$100K+ in Year 1 alone."
3. **PPU Upside — Pre-Restructure Equity:** "OpenAI's PPUs carry massive upside as the company transitions toward a for-profit structure. My equity is priced at current valuation with exposure to a potential $300B+ valuation at restructure/IPO."
4. **ChatGPT Platform Scale:** "I build infrastructure for the fastest-growing consumer product in history. ChatGPT's 200M+ WAU means my engineering decisions impact more users than almost any other role in tech."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $218K base and $415K PPUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer role at OpenAI. I build infrastructure for the fastest-growing AI platform in history, and OpenAI's No-Cliff Day-1 vesting means I start earning equity immediately — unlike competitors with 12-month cliffs. I have competing offers from [Google at $285K TC / Anthropic at $295K TC with higher base]. OpenAI's frontier AI mission and PPU upside are uniquely compelling, but the equity grant must reflect the platform's scale and my contribution to it." Accept at $200K+ base and $375K+ PPUs.
