| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Security Engineers protect the most consequential AI systems in the world. You secure the infrastructure that trains and serves frontier models, defend against prompt injection and model extraction attacks, protect user data for 200M+ weekly active users, and ensure the security of the API platform that thousands of enterprises depend on. This is the highest-stakes security role in AI: a breach at OpenAI wouldn't just compromise user data — it could leak frontier model weights, expose training data, or compromise the AI safety infrastructure that the world depends on.

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a Security Engineer, I protect OpenAI's most valuable assets — model weights, training data, user data, and infrastructure — from Day 1. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs reflect that immediate security responsibility. A cliff at competitors costs $80K-$142K in foregone equity. Given that security impact is immediate (threats don't wait for cliffs), No-Cliff vesting appropriately aligns compensation with responsibility."

**Global Levers**

1. **Highest-Stakes AI Security:** "I protect frontier model weights, training data, and infrastructure at the world's most consequential AI company. A security breach at OpenAI has implications that extend far beyond traditional enterprise security."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "Security threats don't wait 12 months. My protection of OpenAI's assets starts from Day 1, and No-Cliff vesting means $80K-$142K in equity that reflects that immediate responsibility."
3. **AI-Specific Security Challenges:** "I defend against novel AI-specific threats — prompt injection, model extraction, training data poisoning, jailbreaking — that require unique security expertise no other company faces at this scale."
4. **Enterprise Trust & Revenue:** "Enterprise customers (Fortune 500, governments) require OpenAI to meet the highest security standards. My work directly enables enterprise deals and revenue growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $275K base and $558K PPUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer role. I protect the most consequential AI systems in the world — frontier model weights, 200M+ users' data, and enterprise infrastructure. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $80K-$142K in equity I'd earn in Year 1 that competitors withhold. I have competing security offers from [Google at $385K TC / Meta at $378K TC]. OpenAI's AI-specific security challenges and PPU upside are unique, but equity must reflect the unprecedented security responsibility." Accept at $255K+ base and $498K+ PPUs.
