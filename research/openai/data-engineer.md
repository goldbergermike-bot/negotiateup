### Data Engineer | OpenAI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Equity-Heavy + PPU (Profit Participation Units) | Frontier AI Lab | No-Cliff Vesting (Dec 2025+)

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (PPU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $195K–$242K | $248K–$432K | — | $257K–$350K |
| Seattle | $188K–$235K | $248K–$432K | — | $250K–$343K |
| London | £135K–£170K | £180K–£315K | — | £180K–£249K |

**Negotiation DNA**

OpenAI Data Engineers build the data infrastructure that powers frontier AI — training data pipelines, RLHF data systems, evaluation datasets, user analytics pipelines, and the data infrastructure that enables 200M+ weekly ChatGPT users. This is the most consequential data engineering in the world: the quality of your pipelines directly determines the quality of GPT models. A data pipeline bug doesn't just cause bad dashboards — it can corrupt model training, degrade AI safety, or misrepresent user behavior at global scale. [Source: OpenAI DE Comp 2025-2026]

**No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting — The Liquidity Revolution**

OpenAI eliminated the 1-year vesting cliff in December 2025. New hires now begin vesting equity from Day 1. "As a Data Engineer, my pipelines feed directly into model training — my impact on model quality starts from Day 1. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means my PPUs reflect that immediate value contribution. A cliff at Google or Meta costs $62K-$108K in foregone equity. Data quality is foundational, and compensation should vest foundationally — from Day 1."

**Global Levers**

1. **Training Data = Model Quality:** "My data pipelines directly determine GPT model quality. The quality of training data, RLHF data, and evaluation datasets is the single most important factor in frontier model performance. I build the data infrastructure that makes OpenAI's models the best in the world."
2. **No-Cliff Day-1 Vesting:** "My data infrastructure impact begins immediately. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $62K-$108K in equity that competitors withhold while my pipelines are already feeding model training."
3. **RLHF Data Infrastructure:** "I build the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) data pipelines that align GPT models with human preferences. This data infrastructure is what makes OpenAI's models safe and useful."
4. **200M+ User Analytics:** "I build analytics pipelines for 200M+ weekly users — one of the largest user behavior datasets in tech. My data infrastructure informs product decisions and model improvements at unprecedented scale."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $238K base and $425K PPUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer role. My pipelines directly determine GPT model quality — training data infrastructure is the most foundational work at a frontier AI lab. OpenAI's No-Cliff vesting means $62K-$108K in equity I'd earn in Year 1 that competitors withhold. I have competing DE offers from [Google at $335K TC / Scale AI at $342K TC]. OpenAI's training data scale and PPU upside are unique." Accept at $218K+ base and $382K+ PPUs.
