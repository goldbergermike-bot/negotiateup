**Negotiation DNA**
Product Designers at Harvey AI design the experience of AI-assisted legal work — the document review interface, legal research results, contract analysis outputs, and the overall workflow that integrates AI into lawyers' daily practice. Designing for lawyers is uniquely challenging: they demand precision in information presentation, need to verify AI outputs against sources, require comprehensive citation, and have deeply established workflows that any new tool must integrate with rather than disrupt.
