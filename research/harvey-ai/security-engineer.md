**Negotiation DNA**
Security Engineers at Harvey AI protect the most confidential data in the enterprise world — attorney-client privileged communications, merger and acquisition details, litigation strategy, and regulatory investigation materials. Legal data security has the highest stakes in enterprise tech: a data breach at a law firm could expose billions in deal value, violate attorney-client privilege, and create malpractice liability. Harvey's security must meet not just standard enterprise compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001) but the legal profession's unique confidentiality requirements — ethical walls, conflict checks, and data isolation between clients and matters.
