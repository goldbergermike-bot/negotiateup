### Legal AI Engineer | Harvey AI Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Competitive Comp + Pre-IPO Equity | $2B+ Valuation | San Francisco | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | **+15-30% ML PREMIUM** | Legal AI Pioneer

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Pre-IPO/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| San Francisco | $225K-$305K | $180K-$430K | — | $270K-$413K |
| New York City | $225K-$305K | $180K-$430K | — | $270K-$413K |
| Remote US | $203K-$275K | $162K-$387K | — | $243K-$372K |

**Negotiation DNA**
The Legal AI Engineer is Harvey AI's signature role — the position at the core of building AI that is transforming the $1 trillion legal industry. You will build and optimize the AI systems that assist lawyers with legal research, document review, contract analysis, due diligence, and litigation support — work that currently costs law firms hundreds of dollars per hour in attorney time. Harvey's AI must meet the legal profession's extraordinary accuracy and reliability standards: a hallucinated case citation or incorrect contract clause analysis could have severe consequences. This means building AI systems with retrieval-augmented generation, legal knowledge verification, citation accuracy checks, and domain-specific fine-tuning that make Harvey trusted by the world's top law firms (including Allen & Overy, the first global law firm to adopt Harvey). The +15-30% ML Premium reflects the extreme scarcity of engineers who can build AI systems that meet the legal profession's exacting standards.

**Level Mapping:** Harvey Legal AI Engineer = Google L5-L6 Research Engineer = OpenAI Research Engineer = Anthropic ML Engineer

**The Hot Category Premium — Legal AI at $2B+**
Harvey is in one of the hottest vertical AI categories, with a $2B+ valuation and rapid enterprise adoption by the world's top law firms. The legal AI market is enormous ($1T+ legal industry) and Harvey is the clear leader. Use this: "Harvey is leading the transformation of a trillion-dollar industry. The equity represents asymmetric upside as the company captures more of the legal AI market."

**Global Levers**
1. **Signature Role Scarcity:** "Building AI that meets the legal profession's accuracy standards requires a rare combination of NLP expertise, RAG engineering, domain-specific fine-tuning, and an understanding of legal reasoning. Fewer than 300 engineers in the world have this skill set at production scale: $300K base and $420K equity/4yr."
2. **Legal AI Accuracy Premium:** "Legal AI has zero tolerance for hallucination — a wrong citation or incorrect analysis has real consequences. Building AI systems to this accuracy standard is extraordinarily difficult. That reliability premium: $295K base."
3. **Competing Offers:** "OpenAI offers $285K / $650K equity for domain-specific AI research. Anthropic at $280K / $500K equity. Harvey's legal AI focus and market position: $300K base and $425K equity/4yr."
4. **Industry Transformation Impact:** "Harvey is transforming a trillion-dollar industry. My AI improvements directly increase the value of legal work that can be automated, driving revenue growth: $295K base."
5. **Elite Client Relationships:** "Harvey serves the world's top law firms. The trust premium — building AI that elite lawyers trust with client matters — is extraordinary: $300K base."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm an AI engineer who has built domain-specific AI systems with production-grade accuracy — RAG pipelines, knowledge verification, and domain fine-tuning. I'm holding an OpenAI offer at $285K / $650K equity and an Anthropic offer at $280K / $500K equity. Harvey is transforming the legal industry, and I want to build the AI that makes it happen. To join: $300K base, $420K equity/4yr with 35% year-one vesting, and a $65K signing bonus. The ML Premium applies — legal AI accuracy engineering is in extreme demand. At $300K, I sign immediately. Floor is $270K."
