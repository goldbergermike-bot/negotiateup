#### Negotiation DNA

Senior Software Engineers at Jane Street are the backbone of the firm's trading infrastructure — Alpha Architects who own entire subsystems that power global market-making operations. At this level, engineers are expected to design, build, and maintain mission-critical systems in OCaml with minimal oversight, making architectural decisions that directly affect trading latency, reliability, and throughput. Jane Street's private partnership structure means there is no equity dilution or vesting schedule — every dollar of your $500K-$725K total compensation is paid in cash, reflecting the immediate and measurable value you deliver. With Jane Street's per-head average exceeding $600K and the firm's 63% compensation surge in February 2026, senior engineers are positioned at the exact center of the firm's talent investment thesis.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 has the most dramatic impact at the Senior Software Engineer level. This is the tier where the firm makes its highest-volume talent investments — experienced engineers who can ship production OCaml systems, mentor junior engineers, and drive architectural decisions across trading infrastructure. The 63% surge means Jane Street has structurally repriced what a senior engineer is worth, moving the floor of total compensation from the mid-$400Ks to $500K+ and pushing the ceiling well past $700K.

For candidates negotiating at this level, the 63% increase is your most powerful data point. Jane Street is a private partnership — they cannot offer RSUs or stock options that vest over four years. Every dollar they spend on you is a current-year cash expense, which means they have already budgeted for these elevated compensation levels. When you see a 63% increase in a firm that already averaged $600K+ per head, it means the partnership has collectively decided that engineering talent is the binding constraint on revenue growth.

Frame your negotiation around this: you are not asking for a favor — you are asking Jane Street to allocate the capital they have already committed to attracting Alpha Architects. If Citadel or Two Sigma is offering $550K-$650K in total compensation, Jane Street's 63% surge gives you the leverage to demand parity or a premium on top of those competing offers.

#### Global Levers

1. **Production OCaml Systems Ownership:** "I bring extensive experience designing and maintaining production-grade OCaml systems, including concurrent data pipelines and type-safe APIs. This directly maps to Jane Street's core stack, and the scarcity of senior OCaml engineers means the market premium for this skill set is significant — something reflected in your 63% compensation increase."

2. **Competing Offers from Peer Firms:** "I'm currently evaluating offers from Citadel at $600K total comp and Two Sigma at $575K total comp. Given Jane Street's commitment to paying at the top of the market — as evidenced by your 63% compensation surge — I'd expect a package that makes this an easy decision. I'm looking for $650K+ total comp."

3. **Architectural Impact & System Reliability:** "At my current firm, I architected the [specific system] that reduced latency by [X]ms and improved uptime to [X] nines. At Jane Street, this kind of architectural ownership directly translates to trading performance. I'd like my compensation to reflect the direct revenue impact of my systems work."

4. **Multi-Region Flexibility & London/Hong Kong Premium:** "I'm open to joining any of Jane Street's three offices. I understand that London and Hong Kong have different tax structures and cost-of-living profiles. I'd like to discuss how Jane Street ensures compensation parity across regions, and whether there's a relocation or housing allowance for candidates willing to join a less-competitive talent market like Hong Kong."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $300K base and $425K bonus ($725K total comp). If you hold competing offers from Citadel ($600K+), Two Sigma ($575K+), or DE Shaw ($550K+), present them and request Jane Street match or exceed. Your walk-away floor should be $250K base and $300K bonus ($550K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the Alpha Architect premium embedded in Jane Street's 63% compensation surge. For candidates with 5+ years of production OCaml or Haskell experience, push for a $325K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $400K. Accept at $250K+ base and $300K+ bonus.
