#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at Jane Street are Alpha Architects who design the end-to-end technical architecture connecting the firm's trading strategies to market execution. This role requires an unusual combination of deep systems thinking, understanding of market microstructure, and the ability to design solutions that span multiple trading desks, asset classes, and geographic regions. Unlike Solutions Architects at technology companies who design customer-facing systems, Jane Street SAs design internal architectures that must operate at microsecond latencies with absolute correctness — a single architectural flaw can result in millions of dollars in trading losses. With all-cash compensation of $400K-$575K total comp and Jane Street's $600K+ per-head investment philosophy, Solutions Architects are compensated as senior technical leaders whose decisions shape the firm's trading capability for years. The 63% compensation surge in February 2026 has elevated SA compensation to levels that compete with front-office trading roles.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 has a particularly strong impact on Solutions Architect compensation because SAs operate at the intersection of technology strategy and trading operations. The 63% surge reflects the partnership's understanding that architectural decisions are among the highest-leverage activities at the firm — a well-designed system architecture can improve trading performance by orders of magnitude, while a poorly designed one can create bottlenecks that limit the firm's ability to capture market opportunities.

For SA candidates, the 63% increase means Jane Street is prepared to pay for architectural vision at levels that were previously reserved for front-office quantitative roles. The firm recognizes that the distinction between "technology" and "trading" is artificial — at Jane Street, technology is trading, and the architects who design these systems are as valuable as the traders who use them.

Use this framing in your negotiation: your architectural decisions will be embedded in Jane Street's trading infrastructure for years, compounding in value with every trade executed across the systems you design. The 63% compensation surge is the partnership's acknowledgment that this kind of long-duration, high-leverage impact deserves top-of-market compensation.

#### Global Levers

1. **Cross-Desk Architectural Impact:** "I've designed architectures that span multiple trading desks and asset classes, enabling shared infrastructure that reduces development time and improves consistency. At Jane Street, this cross-desk leverage is critical — my architectural decisions will affect every trading strategy that runs on the platforms I design. I'd like compensation that reflects this firm-wide architectural impact."

2. **Competing Architecture Offers:** "I have offers from Citadel at $525K total comp and Two Sigma at $500K total comp for principal architect roles. Given Jane Street's 63% compensation increase and $600K+ per-head average, I'm expecting a total comp of $550K+ to match the firm's stated commitment to Alpha Architect talent."

3. **Low-Latency Systems Design Expertise:** "I specialize in designing low-latency distributed systems for financial markets — including order routing architectures, market data distribution systems, and real-time risk calculation frameworks. This expertise directly maps to Jane Street's core business and commands a premium in the quantitative finance talent market."

4. **Global Architecture & Multi-Region Consistency:** "I have experience designing architectures that maintain consistency across geographically distributed trading operations. At Jane Street, with offices in New York, London, and Hong Kong, this multi-region architecture expertise is essential for ensuring the firm can trade seamlessly across global markets. I'd like a guaranteed first-year bonus of $275K+ and a relocation package if joining a non-headquarters office."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $275K base and $300K bonus ($575K total comp). Present competing offers from Citadel ($525K+), Two Sigma ($500K+), or senior architect roles at FAANG ($550K+ including equity). Your walk-away floor should be $225K base and $225K bonus ($450K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the Alpha Architect premium for architectural leadership at a firm whose trading capacity depends on system design quality. For candidates with prior trading systems architecture experience, push for $300K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $275K. Accept at $225K+ base and $225K+ bonus.
