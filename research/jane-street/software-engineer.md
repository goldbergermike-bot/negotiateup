#### Negotiation DNA

Jane Street Software Engineers are Alpha Architects who build the foundational systems powering one of the world's most sophisticated quantitative trading operations. Unlike typical software engineering roles, Jane Street engineers write production trading infrastructure in OCaml, a functional programming language that demands exceptional mathematical reasoning and type-theoretic rigor. Every line of code directly impacts the firm's ability to provide liquidity across global markets. With Jane Street's per-head compensation averaging $600K+, even entry-level engineers are expected to generate outsized value from day one. The firm's 63% compensation surge in February 2026 confirms that Jane Street is aggressively competing for the most technically gifted engineers in the world, making this the strongest negotiating environment in a decade.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 is not incremental — it is a structural repricing of technical talent across the quantitative finance industry. This surge signals that Jane Street's leadership views engineering talent as the primary constraint on alpha generation and market-making capacity. For Software Engineer candidates, this means the firm has explicitly budgeted for above-market offers and is prepared to pay premiums that would have been unthinkable two years ago.

As a candidate, you should frame every negotiation conversation around this data point. Jane Street is a private partnership with no public equity to offer — their entire compensation philosophy is built on cash. When the firm increases cash compensation spending by 63%, it means your base and bonus are the direct levers they use to win talent wars against Citadel, Two Sigma, DE Shaw, and Renaissance Technologies. The $600K+ per-head average means even a "standard" offer at Jane Street exceeds total compensation at most Big Tech companies by 2-3x.

Use this information to anchor your expectations at the top of the range. If Jane Street is willing to spend 63% more on compensation, they are willing to negotiate. Your OCaml expertise, systems thinking, and quantitative aptitude are the rare inputs that justify this Alpha Architect premium.

#### Global Levers

1. **OCaml & Functional Programming Expertise Premium:** "My deep experience with OCaml and functional programming paradigms — including type-safe concurrent systems and formal verification — maps directly to Jane Street's core technology stack. This specialization commands a premium because the global talent pool with production OCaml experience is exceptionally small."

2. **Competing Quantitative Fund Offers:** "I have active offers from [Citadel/Two Sigma/DE Shaw] at competitive total compensation levels. Given Jane Street's 63% compensation increase and commitment to attracting Alpha Architects, I'd expect an offer that reflects the top of your range to make this decision straightforward."

3. **Direct Alpha Impact Framing:** "Every system I build at Jane Street directly impacts trading performance and liquidity provision. Unlike roles at technology companies where engineering is a cost center, my work here is a profit center. I'd like my compensation to reflect that direct-to-alpha relationship."

4. **Geographic Arbitrage & Relocation:** "I'm considering opportunities across New York, London, and Hong Kong. Each office has different cost-of-living dynamics and tax implications. I'd like to discuss how Jane Street structures compensation to ensure parity across regions, and whether a relocation package or signing bonus is available to offset transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $225K base and $275K bonus ($500K total comp). If you have a competing offer from Citadel or Two Sigma at $400K+, present it and request Jane Street match at the top of their range. Your walk-away floor should be $200K base and $200K bonus ($400K total comp) — below this, the offer does not reflect the Alpha Architect premium that Jane Street's 63% compensation surge makes possible. For candidates with production OCaml experience or prior quantitative trading firm backgrounds, push for a $250K+ base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $250K+. Accept at $200K+ base and $200K+ bonus.
