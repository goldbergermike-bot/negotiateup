#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at Jane Street are Alpha Architects who sit at the intersection of quantitative research and trading strategy. Unlike data science roles at technology companies — where the focus is on user behavior, A/B testing, and product metrics — Jane Street Data Scientists analyze market microstructure, develop statistical models for price prediction, and discover alpha signals that directly drive trading profitability. Every insight you produce has a measurable dollar impact on the firm's P&L. Jane Street's all-cash compensation of $450K-$650K total comp reflects this direct-to-alpha relationship. The firm's $600K+ per-head average and 63% compensation surge in February 2026 confirm that quantitative talent is the most valuable resource in Jane Street's business model. Data Scientists who can bridge the gap between raw market data and actionable trading signals are among the most sought-after professionals in quantitative finance.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 has the most direct implications for Data Scientists because their work is closest to the revenue-generating core of the firm. When Jane Street increases compensation by 63%, it is investing in the people who discover the signals, build the models, and refine the strategies that generate trading profits.

For Data Scientist candidates, this surge means two things. First, Jane Street's compensation floor has risen significantly — packages that would have been $400K-$500K in 2024 are now $450K-$650K. Second, the firm is signaling that it will pay whatever is necessary to win bidding wars against Citadel, Two Sigma, DE Shaw, and Renaissance Technologies for quantitative talent.

The 63% increase is especially powerful leverage because Data Scientists at Jane Street operate in a talent market with zero slack. The number of people in the world who can do rigorous quantitative research, work with functional programming toolchains, and translate statistical insights into trading strategies is vanishingly small. When Jane Street increases its compensation budget by 63%, it is competing for a talent pool measured in hundreds, not thousands. Use this scarcity to anchor your expectations at the top of the range.

#### Global Levers

1. **Alpha Signal Discovery Track Record:** "I have a demonstrated track record of discovering alpha signals that generated [$X]M in annual PnL at my current firm. At Jane Street, my quantitative research would directly feed into market-making and trading strategies. I expect compensation that reflects this direct-to-revenue impact — specifically, a total comp of $600K+ that aligns with Jane Street's per-head investment in Alpha Architects."

2. **Competing Quantitative Research Offers:** "I have offers from Citadel Quantitative Research at $575K total comp and Two Sigma at $550K total comp. Given Jane Street's 63% compensation increase and its commitment to being the top payer for quantitative talent, I'm expecting $625K+ to make this a straightforward decision."

3. **Statistical Modeling & Market Microstructure Expertise:** "My expertise spans advanced statistical modeling, market microstructure analysis, and causal inference in high-frequency data environments. This combination is directly applicable to Jane Street's trading operations and exceptionally rare in the talent market. I'd like a compensation package that reflects this specialization."

4. **Research Infrastructure & Tooling Contributions:** "Beyond pure research, I've built data pipelines, backtesting frameworks, and signal evaluation platforms that accelerated the entire research team's output. At Jane Street, where the OCaml ecosystem requires custom research tooling, my ability to build infrastructure alongside conducting research is a force multiplier. I'd like a guaranteed first-year bonus of $325K+ to reflect this dual contribution."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $300K base and $350K bonus ($650K total comp). Present competing offers from Citadel QR ($575K+), Two Sigma ($550K+), or DE Shaw ($525K+). Your walk-away floor should be $250K base and $250K bonus ($500K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the Alpha Architect premium for quantitative research talent. For candidates with PhD-level training in statistics, mathematics, or physics and prior quant fund experience, push for $325K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $325K. Accept at $250K+ base and $250K+ bonus.
