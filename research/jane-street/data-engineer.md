#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at Jane Street are Alpha Architects who build and maintain the real-time data infrastructure that powers every trading decision the firm makes. At a quantitative trading firm, data is not a byproduct of the business — it is the business. Jane Street Data Engineers construct pipelines that ingest, transform, and deliver market data, order flow data, and risk metrics at microsecond latencies across global trading operations. The firm's OCaml-based technology stack means Data Engineers work with functional programming paradigms to build type-safe, fault-tolerant data systems that process terabytes of market data daily. With all-cash compensation of $375K-$535K total comp and the firm's $600K+ per-head average, Data Engineers are compensated as critical infrastructure builders whose systems directly enable alpha generation. Jane Street's 63% compensation surge in February 2026 reflects the escalating importance of real-time data infrastructure in modern quantitative trading.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 directly impacts Data Engineer compensation because the firm's ability to trade profitably is fundamentally constrained by data infrastructure quality. Every trading strategy at Jane Street begins with data — market prices, order book depth, historical patterns, and real-time execution metrics. The Data Engineers who build the pipelines delivering this data are the upstream enablers of everything the firm does.

The 63% surge means Jane Street has structurally increased what it pays for data engineering talent, recognizing that the volume, velocity, and variety of market data are growing exponentially. As markets become more electronic and more global, the Data Engineers who can build systems to process this data at scale and speed become proportionally more valuable.

For candidates, the 63% increase means you should benchmark your expectations against the upper end of the range. If competing offers from Citadel or Two Sigma are in the $400K-$475K range, Jane Street's 63% surge gives you the leverage to demand parity or better. The firm has explicitly budgeted for above-market compensation, and Data Engineers with real-time streaming data and functional programming expertise are precisely the Alpha Architects this budget was created to attract.

#### Global Levers

1. **Real-Time Market Data Pipeline Expertise:** "I've built real-time data pipelines that process millions of market events per second with sub-millisecond latency. At Jane Street, this expertise directly enables the firm's market-making and trading operations. The scarcity of data engineers with real-time streaming experience in functional programming environments commands a significant premium."

2. **Competing Data Engineering Offers:** "I have offers from Citadel at $475K total comp and Two Sigma at $460K total comp for data engineering roles. Given Jane Street's 63% compensation increase and commitment to being the top payer for data infrastructure talent, I'm expecting $510K+ in total cash compensation."

3. **OCaml/Functional Programming Data Systems:** "I have experience building data pipelines in functional programming languages, which maps directly to Jane Street's OCaml-based stack. Data engineers who can write type-safe, concurrent data processing systems in OCaml or similar functional languages are extraordinarily rare. I'd like my compensation to reflect this unique skill alignment."

4. **Data Quality & Trading Signal Integrity:** "Data quality directly determines trading signal quality. My track record includes implementing data validation frameworks that reduced data errors by [X]%, preventing millions in potential trading losses from bad data. At Jane Street, this data integrity work is foundational to every trading strategy. I'd like a guaranteed first-year bonus of $260K+ to reflect the downstream impact of high-quality data infrastructure."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $250K base and $285K bonus ($535K total comp). Present competing offers from Citadel ($475K+), Two Sigma ($460K+), or FAANG data engineering roles ($450K+ including equity). Your walk-away floor should be $210K base and $210K bonus ($420K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the Alpha Architect premium for data engineering at a firm where every trading decision depends on data infrastructure quality. For candidates with real-time market data pipeline experience or functional programming backgrounds, push for $275K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $260K. Accept at $210K+ base and $210K+ bonus.
