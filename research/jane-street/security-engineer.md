#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at Jane Street are Alpha Architects who protect the firm's most valuable asset: its trading infrastructure and proprietary algorithms. A security breach at a quantitative trading firm is not a data privacy incident — it is an existential threat that could expose proprietary trading strategies, compromise order routing systems, or enable unauthorized market activity. Jane Street Security Engineers design and implement zero-trust architectures, secure the firm's OCaml-based codebase, manage cryptographic infrastructure, and defend against sophisticated adversaries targeting the financial sector. With all-cash compensation of $375K-$535K total comp and the firm's $600K+ per-head average, Security Engineers are compensated as frontline defenders of billions of dollars in trading activity. The 63% compensation surge in February 2026 reflects Jane Street's recognition that cybersecurity threats to quantitative trading firms are escalating and that elite security talent is the only countermeasure.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 has elevated Security Engineer compensation in response to the escalating cyber threat landscape facing quantitative trading firms. Nation-state actors, sophisticated criminal organizations, and insider threats all target firms like Jane Street because of the massive financial assets under their control and the value of their proprietary trading algorithms.

The 63% surge means Jane Street is no longer benchmarking Security Engineer compensation against technology companies — the firm is benchmarking against the existential risk that a security failure poses to the partnership's capital. When a single security incident could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, paying $375K-$535K for a Security Engineer who prevents that incident is an asymmetric investment.

For Security Engineer candidates, this 63% increase provides powerful negotiation leverage. The cybersecurity talent shortage is acute across all industries, and it is even more severe in quantitative finance, where security engineers need domain expertise in trading systems, financial regulations, and low-latency infrastructure alongside their security skills. Use this scarcity and the 63% surge to anchor your expectations at the top of the range.

#### Global Levers

1. **Existential Risk Protection Value:** "My work at Jane Street protects the firm against existential cybersecurity risks. A single breach of the trading infrastructure could cost hundreds of millions in direct losses and reputational damage. The asymmetric value of preventing that outcome justifies compensation at the top of the range — I'm looking for $500K+ total comp to reflect the magnitude of what I protect."

2. **Competing Security Offers from Finance and Tech:** "I have offers from Citadel Security at $475K total comp and [Google/Microsoft] Security at $500K total comp including equity. Given Jane Street's all-cash structure and 63% compensation surge, I'm expecting $510K+ in total cash compensation. Security talent at this level is scarce, and cash comp of $510K reflects the urgency of the threat landscape."

3. **Financial Infrastructure Security Specialization:** "I specialize in securing financial trading infrastructure — including order management systems, market data feeds, and algorithmic trading platforms. This domain expertise is rare and directly relevant to Jane Street's core operations. Standard security engineers cannot step into this role without years of domain-specific training."

4. **Zero-Trust & Cryptographic Infrastructure Expertise:** "I've designed and implemented zero-trust architectures and managed cryptographic infrastructure for regulated financial institutions. At Jane Street, where data integrity and access control are paramount, this expertise ensures the firm meets regulatory requirements while maintaining the flexibility that trading operations demand. I'd like a guaranteed first-year bonus of $260K+ to reflect this specialized capability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $250K base and $285K bonus ($535K total comp). Present competing offers from Citadel ($475K+), Two Sigma ($450K+), or FAANG security teams ($475K+ including equity). Your walk-away floor should be $210K base and $210K bonus ($420K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the Alpha Architect premium for security engineering at a firm where a single breach could cost hundreds of millions. For candidates with prior financial trading infrastructure security experience, push for $275K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $260K. Accept at $210K+ base and $210K+ bonus.
