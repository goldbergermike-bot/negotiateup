#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at Jane Street are Alpha Architects who ensure the firm's trading infrastructure operates with near-perfect reliability across global markets. At a quantitative trading firm, infrastructure downtime is not an inconvenience — it is a direct revenue loss measured in millions of dollars per hour. Jane Street DevOps Engineers manage the deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and infrastructure automation that keep OCaml-based trading systems running 24/7 across New York, London, and Hong Kong. The firm's all-cash compensation of $350K-$500K total comp makes this one of the highest-paying DevOps roles in any industry. Jane Street's private partnership structure means there are no RSUs or equity grants — every dollar is paid in cash, reflecting the immediate and measurable value of infrastructure reliability. The 63% compensation surge in February 2026 confirms that Jane Street views infrastructure engineering as a core competency, not a cost center.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 directly benefits DevOps Engineers because the firm's trading capacity is ultimately constrained by infrastructure reliability. When Jane Street scales its trading volume, it needs proportionally more robust infrastructure — and the engineers who build and maintain that infrastructure become more valuable with every dollar of additional trading volume.

The 63% surge means Jane Street has moved DevOps compensation from levels competitive with Big Tech ($250K-$350K) to levels competitive with quantitative finance ($350K-$500K). This represents a structural repricing of infrastructure talent, driven by the recognition that a single infrastructure failure during peak trading hours can cost the firm more than an entire year's compensation for a DevOps team.

For candidates, this surge provides direct negotiation leverage. You can frame your value proposition around uptime economics: if Jane Street's trading infrastructure generates $X billion in annual volume, and your work ensures 99.99% uptime versus 99.9% uptime, the incremental value you create dwarfs your total compensation. The 63% increase shows Jane Street's partnership understands this math.

#### Global Levers

1. **Uptime Economics & Revenue Protection:** "Infrastructure reliability directly protects Jane Street's revenue. If the firm's trading systems generate $X billion in daily volume, every minute of downtime costs millions. My track record of maintaining [X] nines of uptime in production trading environments translates to tens of millions in protected revenue. I expect compensation that reflects this revenue-protection value."

2. **Competing Infrastructure Offers from Finance and Tech:** "I have offers from Citadel Infrastructure at $425K total comp and [AWS/Google Cloud] at $450K total comp including equity. Given Jane Street's all-cash compensation model and 63% compensation surge, I'm expecting $475K+ in total cash comp. Cash is more valuable than RSUs, and I'd like Jane Street's offer to reflect that."

3. **Low-Latency Infrastructure Specialization:** "I specialize in low-latency infrastructure for trading systems — including kernel tuning, network optimization, and bare-metal deployment automation. This specialization is directly relevant to Jane Street's market-making operations and is extremely rare in the DevOps talent market. I'd like a premium above standard DevOps compensation."

4. **Global Multi-Region Operations Experience:** "I have experience managing infrastructure across multiple geographic regions with strict latency and regulatory requirements. At Jane Street, where trading operations span New York, London, and Hong Kong, this multi-region expertise is critical. I'd like to discuss a relocation allowance and a guaranteed first-year bonus of $250K+ to reflect this global operational capability."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $225K base and $275K bonus ($500K total comp). Present competing offers from Citadel ($425K+), Two Sigma ($400K+), or cloud infrastructure roles at FAANG ($400K+ including equity). Your walk-away floor should be $200K base and $200K bonus ($400K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the Alpha Architect premium for infrastructure reliability at a firm that cannot tolerate downtime. For candidates with prior trading infrastructure or low-latency systems experience, push for $250K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $250K. Accept at $200K+ base and $200K+ bonus.
