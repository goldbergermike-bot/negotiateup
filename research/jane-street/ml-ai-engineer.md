#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at Jane Street are Alpha Architects who build the machine learning models and AI systems that give the firm its competitive edge in quantitative trading. This is not a role where you fine-tune open-source models for chatbots — at Jane Street, ML/AI Engineers develop proprietary models for market prediction, execution optimization, risk management, and alpha signal discovery. The work requires deep expertise in statistical learning theory, time series analysis, and the ability to deploy models into production OCaml systems with sub-millisecond inference latency. The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium on top of already-elite compensation reflects the extraordinary scarcity of ML engineers who can operate at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and quantitative finance production systems. With all-cash compensation of $525K-$775K total comp and Jane Street's $600K+ per-head average, ML/AI Engineers are among the highest-compensated machine learning professionals in the world. The 63% compensation surge in February 2026 has pushed ML/AI compensation at Jane Street into territory that competes directly with AI research scientist packages at frontier labs.

#### 63% Compensation Surge — The Alpha Architect Premium

Jane Street's 63% increase in compensation spending in February 2026 has the most explosive effect on ML/AI Engineer compensation. The quantitative trading industry is in the midst of a fundamental transformation driven by machine learning — and the firms that attract the best ML talent will dominate the next decade of trading. Jane Street's 63% surge is a direct response to this reality.

The +15-25% AI/Quant Premium exists because ML/AI Engineers at Jane Street compete in three overlapping talent markets: (1) frontier AI research labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind) offering $500K-$1M+ total comp, (2) Big Tech ML teams (Google Brain, Meta FAIR) offering $400K-$800K with equity, and (3) peer quantitative funds (Citadel, Two Sigma, Renaissance) offering $500K-$700K. Jane Street must outbid all three categories, and the 63% compensation surge gives the firm the budget to do so.

For ML/AI Engineer candidates, this is the strongest negotiating position in the history of quantitative finance ML roles. The convergence of the AI talent shortage, Jane Street's 63% compensation increase, and the transformative impact of ML on trading means you can credibly demand $700K+ total compensation. Any offer below $550K fails to account for the market dynamics that Jane Street's own compensation surge has validated.

#### Global Levers

1. **Alpha-Generating ML Model Track Record:** "I have built ML models that generated measurable alpha — specifically, [model type] that improved [metric] by [X]% and contributed [$X]M in annual PnL at my current firm. At Jane Street, my ML expertise would directly feed into trading strategies and market-making optimization. I expect compensation that reflects this direct-to-alpha impact, including the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium."

2. **Competing Offers from AI Labs and Peer Funds:** "I have offers from [OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepMind] at $800K total comp and Citadel ML Research at $650K total comp. Given Jane Street's 63% compensation surge and the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium, I'm expecting $725K+ in total cash compensation. Jane Street's all-cash structure is compelling, but the package needs to be competitive with frontier AI lab offers."

3. **Production ML in Low-Latency Environments:** "I specialize in deploying ML models into production systems with sub-millisecond inference requirements — including model quantization, FPGA inference, and custom C++/OCaml serving infrastructure. This production ML expertise is what separates a research paper from a trading strategy, and it commands a premium above standard ML engineer compensation."

4. **Research Publication & Community Leadership:** "I have [X] publications in top ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) and am recognized as an expert in [specific ML domain]. At Jane Street, this research capability enables the firm to stay at the frontier of ML applications in trading. I'd like a guaranteed first-year bonus of $400K+ and a research budget to attend and present at top conferences."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor your ask at $350K base and $425K bonus ($775K total comp). Present competing offers from OpenAI/Anthropic ($750K+), Citadel ML Research ($650K+), or Two Sigma ($625K+). Your walk-away floor should be $275K base and $300K bonus ($575K total comp) — below this, the offer fails to reflect the +15-25% AI/Quant Premium and Jane Street's 63% compensation surge. For candidates with PhD-level ML expertise and prior quant fund experience, push for $375K base with a guaranteed first-year bonus of $400K. Accept at $275K+ base and $300K+ bonus.
