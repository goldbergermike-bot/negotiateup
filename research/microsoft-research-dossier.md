## 1. COMPANY PROFILE

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Full Legal Name** | Microsoft Corporation |
| **Headquarters** | One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052, USA |
| **Global Headcount** | ~228,000 full-time employees (125,000 US / 103,000 international) [Microsoft 10-K FY2025] |
| **FY2025 Revenue** | $252 billion (Cloud revenue: $168.9B) [Microsoft 2025 Annual Report] |
| **Negotiation DNA** | **Equity-Heavy + Performance-Driven** |
| **CEO** | Satya Nadella (since February 2014) |
| **Stock Ticker** | MSFT (NASDAQ) |

### Compensation Philosophy Summary

Microsoft operates one of the most structured compensation systems in big tech, organized around a numbered **Level system (57-80+)** that directly dictates base salary bands, equity grant ranges, bonus target percentages, and signing bonus ceilings. Under Satya Nadella's leadership since 2014, the company has undergone a fundamental shift from a **cash-heavy, stack-ranked model** to an **equity-heavy, growth-mindset, performance-driven** compensation architecture.

Key pillars of the current philosophy:
- **Equity as the primary wealth-creation lever**: On-hire stock awards and annual stock refreshers dominate total comp at L63+, with quarterly vesting providing consistent liquidity
- **Performance multipliers on bonus and stock**: The "Connects" system replaced stack ranking in 2013; annual rewards (bonus + stock refresh) are calibrated against individual impact, team contribution, and growth mindset behaviors
- **Level-based band rigidity with within-band flexibility**: Recruiters have meaningful room to move within a level's band but require VP-level approval to exceed published ceilings
- **Geographic pay scales**: A "Main" scale (Redmond/most US) and "High" scale (Bay Area, NYC) with ~8-15% premium; international offices follow separate, region-adjusted bands
- **2022 Compensation Reset**: Nadella announced Microsoft would "nearly double" the global merit budget and raise annual stock ranges by at least 25% for employees at L67 and below, specifically targeting early- and mid-career employees [GeekWire 2022]

### Key Cultural Signals That Affect Negotiation

1. **"Growth Mindset" Culture**: Nadella's signature cultural transformation means Microsoft values collaboration over individual heroics. Negotiation framing should emphasize team impact and learning agility, not just individual leverage.
2. **"One Microsoft"**: The elimination of internal competitive silos means cross-team mobility is valued; candidates can negotiate team placement as part of their offer.
3. **Team Matters Enormously**: Azure, AI Platform, Microsoft 365, Gaming (Xbox/Activision Blizzard), LinkedIn, and GitHub operate with meaningfully different compensation cultures, urgency levels, and flexibility. Azure and AI teams currently have the most aggressive comp packages.
4. **Quarterly Vesting = Retention Lever**: Unlike Apple's annual cliff-heavy vesting, Microsoft's quarterly vest creates steady income and reduces "golden handcuff" pressure, which affects counter-offer dynamics.
5. **Performance Reviews Drive Recurring Comp**: Annual rewards (August) set the trajectory; a strong first-year review compounds significantly due to 5-year annual refresh vesting stacking on top of the 4-year on-hire grant.

## 2. RECOMMENDED ROLES (14 Roles)

| # | Role Title (Standardized) | Internal Level Mapping | Why Relevant for Negotiation Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Software Engineer** | L59-60 (SDE), L61-62 (SDE II) | Highest-volume hire; most public comp data available; baseline for level negotiation strategies |
| 2 | **Senior Software Engineer** | L63-64 (Senior SDE) | The "Senior" threshold is the single most impactful level negotiation — L63 vs L64 creates a ~$30-50K TC gap |
| 3 | **Principal Software Engineer** | L65-66-67 (Principal SDE) | Partner-track gateway; comp inflects dramatically; equity becomes dominant portion of TC |
| 4 | **Partner / Distinguished Engineer** | L68-69 (Partner), L70 (Distinguished) | Seven-figure TC territory; negotiation involves org-level scope and reporting line |
| 5 | **Engineering Manager** | L63-64 (EM), L65-66 (Senior EM), L67-68 (Director/Partner EM) | Manager track parallels IC; level equivalence means candidates can negotiate IC-to-Manager parity |
| 6 | **Product Manager / Program Manager** | L59-60 (PM), L61-62 (PM II), L63-64 (Senior PM), L65+ (Principal/Partner PM) | Microsoft's PM role is uniquely broad; same level system applies, making cross-discipline comp benchmarking possible |
| 7 | **Data Scientist** | L61-62 (DS II), L63-64 (Senior DS), L65+ (Principal DS) | AI/ML talent war makes this the most aggressively recruited role; competing offers from Meta/Google drive outsized packages |

## 3. COMP BLUEPRINTS

### Methodology Note
All figures synthesize data from the **2025 leaked Microsoft pay guidelines** (updated May 2025), **Levels.fyi verified submissions** (as of February 2026), **H1B LCA filings** (FY2025), and **Glassdoor/Blind self-reports**. Ranges represent P25-P75 for typical offers; outlier packages (AI/ML talent, competing-offer-driven) can exceed these ranges significantly.

## 4. NEGOTIATION LEVERS (BY REGION)

### 4A. North America (US/Canada)

**Lever 1: Competing Offers (Most Powerful)**
Microsoft recruiters are specifically trained to match competing offers from Google, Meta, Amazon, and Apple. The most effective competing offer is from a company at the same or higher level. A verified L5 Google offer or E5 Meta offer presented against an L63 Microsoft offer has historically driven:
- On-hire stock increases of 40-100% above initial offer
- Signing bonus increases of $15K-$30K
- Potential level bump from L63 to L64

**Lever 2: Level Bump Negotiation**
Microsoft assigns multiple sub-levels within each title band. Pushing for a higher level (e.g., L63 to L64 within "Senior SDE") is often easier than pushing base salary above band ceiling. The L63-to-L64 bump alone can mean $30-50K in additional annual TC.

**Lever 3: Team Selection**
Azure, AI Platform (Copilot), and Security teams currently have expanded comp budgets. Candidates can negotiate placement on a high-priority team to access larger equity pools. The hiring manager's org-level headcount priority directly affects what the recruiter can offer.

**Lever 4: Base Salary Flexibility**
Unlike Google and Meta, Microsoft will move meaningfully on base salary (unusual for big tech). This is a key lever for candidates who prefer cash-heavy packages or who are comparing against non-tech offers where equity is less relevant.

**Lever 5: Signing Bonus as Bridge**
If the on-hire stock grant cannot be increased further, signing bonuses can often be increased separately. These are one-time payments and require less approval overhead than increasing the equity component.

**Lever 6: Start Date Negotiation**
Microsoft's August annual reward cycle means employees who start in Q1 (Jan-Mar) get a partial-year review and pro-rated annual rewards. Starting before September ensures inclusion in the next full annual reward cycle. This is a subtle but meaningful long-term lever.

---

### 4B. EMEA (UK / Ireland)

**Lever 1: Pension Contribution Enhancement**
Microsoft UK's standard pension match is ~6-7%. For L65+ hires, negotiating an enhanced employer contribution (up to 10-12%) is achievable and has significant long-term tax-advantaged value. This is a distinctly UK lever that does not exist in US negotiations.

**Lever 2: Notice Period Buy-Out**
UK professionals often have 3-6 month notice periods at their current employer. Microsoft can offer: (a) a signing bonus structured to compensate for the notice period, or (b) a "garden leave buy-out" component. This is a common lever in UK tech negotiations and should be explicitly raised.

**Lever 3: Equity Parity Argument**
UK offers are typically 35-50% below US equivalents in total comp. Candidates can argue for equity parity — pointing out that MSFT stock grants vest in the same currency (USD) regardless of geography and that a London-based engineer's output is equivalent to a Redmond-based engineer's. This argument is strongest for L65+ where the talent pool is genuinely global.

**Lever 4: Relocation / Visa Sponsorship as Leverage**
For non-UK nationals, the Global Talent visa or Skilled Worker visa sponsorship represents meaningful cost to Microsoft. Candidates can leverage this investment as a retention signal that justifies higher initial comp.

**Lever 5: Private Healthcare Upgrade**
Standard Bupa coverage can be enhanced to include family members, dental, and mental health coverage at a relatively low cost to Microsoft but high perceived value to the candidate.

**Lever 6: Annual Leave Enhancement**
Standard is 25 days; negotiating 28-30 days is achievable for senior hires and has minimal budget impact for Microsoft.

---

### 4C. APAC (India — Hyderabad / Bangalore)

**Lever 1: The US Parity Argument**
The most powerful negotiation lever in India is the explicit framing of the India-US compensation delta. At L60, the gap is ~5x. At L66, it narrows to ~2x. For senior hires (L63+), arguing that "my output will be compared to US peers but my compensation is at a 3x discount" can drive meaningful increases, particularly in equity.

**Lever 2: Competing Offers from Google / Amazon India**
Google India and Amazon India pay competitively at senior levels. A verified Google L5 India offer or Amazon L6 India offer creates direct pressure on Microsoft India recruiters. These competing offers are the most effective lever for increasing equity grants.

**Lever 3: Relocation to US as Future Compensation Event**
For candidates interested in eventual US transfer, negotiating an explicit pathway (timing, level expectations, visa sponsorship commitment) at the offer stage creates a "deferred compensation" argument. Internal transfers from India to the US typically come with a 2-3x compensation adjustment.

**Lever 4: Equity Grant Enhancement**
India equity grants are disproportionately lower relative to the US-India base salary gap. A candidate at L63 in India might receive RSUs worth ₹20-30 LPA/year annualized, while a US counterpart receives $55K-$100K/year annualized. Arguing for equity closer to the US-adjusted percentage (rather than the India default) is achievable, especially with competing offers.

**Lever 5: Joining Bonus (Cash)**
India joining bonuses are highly negotiable and can range from ₹5-25 LPA depending on level. These are often not included in initial offers and must be explicitly requested. Framing this as a "transition cost" (covering loss of annual bonus at current employer) is standard practice.

**Lever 6: Variable Pay / Retention Bonus**
Some India offers include a "retention bonus" paid in Year 2 or Year 3, separate from the standard annual bonus. This is a lever for candidates who cannot secure higher equity but want guaranteed future compensation.

## 5. MICROSOFT-SPECIFIC NEGOTIATION PLAYBOOK

### 5.1 The Level System Explained

Microsoft's compensation architecture revolves around a **numbered level system** that determines every element of pay. Understanding this system is the single most important factor in Microsoft negotiation.

#### Individual Contributor (IC) Track

| Level | Title | Seniority | Typical YOE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **57-58** | Support Engineer / IT Ops | Entry (non-eng) | 0-2 | Primarily non-engineering roles |
| **59** | SDE / PM | New Grad / Entry | 0-2 | Standard new grad entry point |
| **60** | SDE / PM | Early Career | 1-3 | Promotion from 59, or experienced new grad |
| **61** | SDE II / PM II | Mid-Level | 2-5 | First "career level" — most common external hire level |
| **62** | SDE II / PM II | Mid-Level (Senior) | 3-6 | Senior end of SDE II band; often targeted for experienced external hires |
| **63** | Senior SDE / Senior PM | Senior | 5-10 | **Critical threshold**: "Senior" title; significant comp jump; most common external senior hire level |
| **64** | Senior SDE / Senior PM | Senior+ | 7-12 | Upper Senior band; hard to reach via internal promo from 63; easier as external hire with competing offer |
| **65** | Principal SDE / Principal PM | Staff/Principal | 10-15 | Partner-track entry; IC leadership scope; comp inflects sharply |
| **66** | Principal SDE / Principal PM | Staff+ | 12-18 | Deep technical authority; owns major systems or platforms |
| **67** | Principal SDE / Principal PM | Senior Staff | 15-20+ | Org-wide technical influence; reports to CVP or VP |
| **68** | Partner | Partner | 15-25+ | Executive level; owns P&L or major technical pillar |
| **69** | Partner | Senior Partner | 18-25+ | CVP-equivalent scope |
| **70** | Distinguished Engineer / VP | Distinguished/VP | 20+ | C-suite adjacent; Technical Fellow track begins here |
| **80** | Technical Fellow | Fellow | 25+ | Highest IC designation; equivalent to CVP/EVP |

#### Manager Track (Parallel to IC)

| Level | Manager Title | IC Equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **63-64** | Engineering Manager (EM) | Senior SDE | First-line manager of 5-10 ICs |
| **65-66** | Senior Engineering Manager / Director | Principal SDE | Manages managers; owns a feature area |
| **67** | Director / Senior Director | Principal SDE (top) | Manages a significant org; 50-100+ engineers |
| **68** | Partner Director / GM | Partner | Executive; owns a product line |
| **69** | Partner / CVP | Senior Partner | Owns a business division |
| **70** | VP / CVP | Distinguished Engineer | Reports to EVP or CEO |

### 5.2 Apple ICT vs Microsoft Level Comparison

This mapping is critical for candidates moving between the two companies or benchmarking offers.

| Apple Level | Apple Title | Microsoft Level | Microsoft Title | Key Comp Difference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ICT2** | Software Engineer (Entry) | **L59-60** | SDE | Apple RSUs vest annually (4-year); MSFT quarterly. Apple base typically higher at entry. |
| **ICT3** | Software Engineer | **L61-62** | SDE II | Comparable base; Apple's annual vest schedule means Year 1 TC can appear lower due to cliff. |
| **ICT4** | Senior Software Engineer | **L63-64** | Senior SDE | **Key comparison point**. Apple ICT4 median TC ~$377K vs MSFT L63 median ~$270K-$370K. Apple leans more base-heavy; MSFT more equity-heavy. |
| **ICT5** | Staff Engineer | **L65-66** | Principal SDE | Apple ICT5 ~$487K median TC. MSFT L65-66 ~$400K-$700K. MSFT higher ceiling via equity; Apple more predictable. |
| **ICT6** | Principal Engineer | **L67-68** | Principal/Partner | Both >$600K TC. Apple more cash-balanced; MSFT dramatically equity-skewed. |

**Key Differentiator — Vesting Schedules:**
- **Apple**: RSUs vest **annually** over 4 years, with many grants being back-loaded (e.g., 25% per year, but sometimes 10/20/30/40). This creates significant Year 1 vs Year 4 TC disparity.
- **Microsoft (On-Hire)**: RSUs vest **annually** over 4 years (25% per year), BUT...
- **Microsoft (Annual Refresh)**: Annual stock awards vest **quarterly** over 5 years (20% per year, ~5% per quarter, in February/May/August/November). This creates **stacking** — by Year 3, an employee has overlapping grants vesting every quarter.
- **Net Effect**: Microsoft's quarterly vesting from refreshes creates smoother, more predictable income. By Year 3-4, a Microsoft employee at L63+ typically has higher annualized equity income than an Apple ICT4 equivalent, due to refresh stacking.

### 5.3 Satya-Era Compensation Changes (Post-2014)

The transformation of Microsoft's compensation philosophy under Satya Nadella is one of the most significant shifts in big tech compensation history.

#### Phase 1: Stack Ranking Elimination (2013-2014)
- **Before**: Forced-curve "stack ranking" where managers rated employees on a bell curve (10% Underachieve / 70% Achieve / 20% Exceed). This pitted teammates against each other and suppressed collaboration.
- **After**: "Connects" system — frequent, qualitative check-ins focused on growth, impact, and collaboration. Bonus and stock allocations shifted from relative ranking to absolute contribution assessment.
- **Negotiation Impact**: Candidates can no longer be told "the curve limits your bonus." Individual performance directly drives rewards.

#### Phase 2: Equity-Forward Shift (2015-2020)
- Microsoft stock price rose from ~$46 (Feb 2014) to ~$220 (Feb 2020) — a **~380% increase**.
- As stock price climbed, Microsoft shifted compensation weight from cash bonus to equity:
  - Pre-Nadella: Typical L63 package was ~60% base, ~20% cash bonus, ~20% equity
  - By 2020: Typical L63 package shifted to ~50% base, ~15% cash bonus, ~35% equity
- Annual stock refresh budgets increased across all levels
- The ESPP discount was maintained at 10%, providing additional equity exposure

#### Phase 3: The 2022 Compensation Reset
In May 2022, Nadella announced the most aggressive compensation adjustment in Microsoft's history:
- **Global merit budget "nearly doubled"**
- **Annual stock ranges raised by at least 25%** for employees at L67 and below
- **Focus on early- and mid-career employees** (not Partner-level executives)
- **Geographic-specific adjustments** to address cost-of-living and local market competition
- **Rationale**: Retention crisis driven by Meta, Google, Amazon, and high-growth startups aggressively poaching Microsoft talent [CNBC 2022; Fortune 2022]

#### Phase 4: AI Talent War Premium (2023-Present)
- AI/ML roles now command **20-40% premium** over equivalent non-AI roles at the same level
- Microsoft raided Inflection AI in 2024, hiring CEO Mustafa Suleyman and top researchers
- Competing packages for AI researchers have reached **$5M-$10M+ per year** at the Distinguished/Fellow level
- Standard compensation bands are being routinely exceeded for AI talent, with VP-level approval
- One-time cash awards (up to 25% of annual bonus) were distributed in FY2024 to retain key talent [CNBC 2024]

#### Pre-Nadella vs Post-Nadella Compensation Summary

| Dimension | Pre-Nadella (Before 2014) | Post-Nadella (2014-Present) |
|---|---|---|
| **Performance System** | Stack ranking / bell curve | "Connects" / growth mindset |
| **Primary Wealth Driver** | Cash bonus (large bonus targets) | Equity (RSU grants + refreshes) |
| **Bonus Philosophy** | Zero-sum within team | Absolute contribution-based |
| **Equity Vesting** | Stock options (historically) | RSUs with quarterly vesting |
| **Comp Adjustments** | Annual, modest | Annual + off-cycle retention grants |
| **Level Flexibility** | Rigid | Slightly more flexible, esp. for AI talent |
| **Geographic Fairness** | US-centric | "Main/High" scales + international adjustments |

### 5.4 How Microsoft Competes with Google / Meta / Amazon

| Dimension | Microsoft Advantage | Microsoft Disadvantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Salary** | More flexible; will move on base unlike Google/Meta | Lower ceiling at L63-64 than Google L5 |
| **Equity** | Quarterly vesting (smoother income) | Lower grant sizes than Meta at equivalent levels |
| **Signing Bonus** | Generous; up to $180K at L67 | Meta can offer $100M+ packages for AI talent |
| **Stock Growth Potential** | MSFT stock has outperformed GOOG/META over 10yr period | Already at $3T+ market cap; less upside vs. growth-stage equity |
| **Annual Refreshes** | Consistent; 5-year vest creates compounding stacks | Max refresh amounts trail Meta's uncapped approach |
| **Work-Life Balance** | Generally better reputation than Amazon/Meta | Some teams (Azure, AI) approaching big tech intensity |
| **Career Stability** | Lower layoff rate historically | 2023-2024 layoffs (~10,000) reduced this advantage |
| **Benefits** | 401(k) 50% match up to $11,250/yr; ESPP; comprehensive healthcare | Google's campus perks and Meta's RSU refreshes seen as superior |

### 5.5 The "Team Matters" Dynamic

Compensation flexibility and culture vary significantly by Microsoft division:

| Division | Comp Aggressiveness | Culture | Negotiation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Azure / Cloud** | Very High | Fast-paced; competitive internally | Largest equity budgets; competing directly with AWS/GCP for talent; most likely to exceed published bands |
| **AI Platform / Copilot** | Extremely High | Startup-like energy; rapid growth | AI premium of 20-40% above standard bands; off-cycle retention grants common |
| **Microsoft 365 / Office** | Moderate | Mature; process-driven; stable | Standard band adherence; less urgency; good WLB |
| **Gaming (Xbox/ABK)** | Moderate-Low | Creative culture; post-acquisition integration | Activision Blizzard integration created comp harmonization challenges; some roles below standard MSFT bands |
| **LinkedIn** | High | Operates semi-independently | Separate comp philosophy; can sometimes exceed MSFT standard bands; different equity structure historically |
| **GitHub** | Moderate-High | Engineering-first; remote-friendly | Comp aligned with MSFT bands but with more remote flexibility; good for candidates prioritizing location independence |
| **Security** | High (and Rising) | Mission-critical; post-breach urgency | Post-2024 security overhaul driving aggressive hiring; Nadella's "security above all" memo creates budget priority |

### 5.6 RSU Vesting Schedule (Key Differentiator)

**On-Hire Stock Awards:**
- Vest over **4 years**, with **25% vesting each year**
- First vesting occurs on your **1-year anniversary**
- Subsequent vests occur annually

**Annual Stock Awards (Refreshes):**
- Granted each **August 31** following performance review
- Vest over **5 years**, with **20% per year** vesting **quarterly**
- Quarterly vesting dates: **February, May, August, November** (FMAN)
- Each quarter, ~5% of the grant vests

**The Stacking Effect:**
By Year 3 at Microsoft, an employee has:
- On-hire grant Year 3 vest (25% of original)
- Year 1 refresh: into its 3rd year of 5-year vest
- Year 2 refresh: into its 2nd year of 5-year vest
- Year 3 refresh: just beginning to vest

This creates compounding quarterly equity income that grows each year. For a Senior SDE (L63) who receives:
- $150K on-hire grant (4yr): $37.5K/yr
- Year 1 refresh: $40K (5yr): $8K/yr
- Year 2 refresh: $50K (5yr): $10K/yr
- Year 3 refresh: $55K (5yr): $11K/yr

By Year 3, the annualized equity income is: $37.5K + $8K + $10K + $11K = **$66.5K/yr in vesting equity**

**Why This Matters for Negotiation:**
- A higher on-hire grant has a **4-year impact**; a higher starting level creates **compounding refresh impact** over the entire tenure
- Negotiating a level bump (L63 to L64) increases not just Year 1 TC but every subsequent refresh ceiling
- Microsoft's quarterly vesting means employees always have equity "in the pipe" — reducing the urgency to leave and strengthening Microsoft's retention position

### 5.7 Annual Stock Refresh and Performance Multiplier System

**How Annual Rewards Work:**
Every August, Microsoft employees receive their "annual rewards" consisting of:
1. **Cash bonus**: Percentage of base salary (target varies by level)
2. **Annual stock award (refresh)**: RSU grant that vests quarterly over 5 years

**Performance Impact:**
- Rewards are determined by manager assessment in the "Connects" framework
- **No fixed distribution curve** — unlike the old stack ranking, there is no mandate for how many "high impact" ratings a manager must give
- The actual multiplier ranges from approximately **0x to 2x** of the "target" amount
- A "strong performance" rating typically yields 1.0-1.3x target
- An "exceptional" rating can yield 1.5-2.0x target
- Underperformance can result in 0x (no bonus or stock award)

**Annual Stock Award Ranges by Level (Leaked 2025 Guidelines):**

| Level | Annual Stock Award Range | Typical "Strong" Award |
|---|---|---|
| L59 | $0-$20K | $8K-$12K |
| L60 | $0-$24K | $10K-$16K |
| L61 | $0-$36K | $15K-$22K |
| L62 | $0-$44K | $18K-$28K |
| L63 | $0-$64K | $25K-$40K |
| L64 | $0-$80K | $32K-$50K |
| L65 | $0-$130K | $50K-$80K |
| L66 | $0-$200K | $80K-$120K |
| L67 | $0-$420K | $150K-$250K |
| L68 | $0-$754K | $250K-$450K |

**Negotiation Implication:**
The annual stock refresh is NOT negotiable at the offer stage — it is determined by future performance. However, **the level you negotiate into** directly determines the **ceiling** of your future refreshes. This is why level negotiation has compounding returns.

## APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE CARD

### For Negotiation Coaches

**Most impactful negotiation move at Microsoft**: Getting the level right. A level bump has compounding returns across base, equity, bonus target, and future refresh ceilings.

**Highest-leverage competing offers**: Google (L5 = MSFT L63-64), Meta (E5 = MSFT L63-64), Amazon (L6 = MSFT L63-64)

**Unique Microsoft advantages to highlight**:
- Quarterly RSU vesting (vs Apple annual, vs Amazon's 5/15/40/40)
- 401(k) 50% match up to IRS limit
- ESPP at 10% discount
- Historically lower PIP/layoff rates than Meta/Amazon (though 2023-2024 changed this)
- Work-life balance reputation (team-dependent)

**Red flags in a Microsoft offer**:
- Level seems low relative to experience (always verify against Levels.fyi benchmarks)
- On-hire stock at "default" rather than "approved" range
- No signing bonus included (almost always negotiable)
- Team assignment is unspecified (Azure/AI > M365 > Gaming for comp flexibility)

**The 3 numbers that matter most**:
1. **Level number** (determines everything)
2. **On-hire stock grant** (4-year wealth driver; most negotiable component)
3. **Annual bonus target %** (fixed by level; cannot be negotiated but indicates your level's comp potential)
