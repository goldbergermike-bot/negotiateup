#### Negotiation DNA

Staff Software Engineers at CyberArk are technical leaders who define architecture, drive cross-team initiatives, and set the technical direction for identity security products. Following the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, staff engineers occupy a uniquely powerful position: they are the architects responsible for designing how CyberArk's privileged access management and identity governance capabilities integrate into the PANW platform at scale. The Identity-First Connectivity strategy depends on staff-level engineers making critical architectural decisions. This is a seller's market — there are very few engineers with deep CyberArk domain expertise and the architectural breadth to execute PANW-scale integration.

**Level Mapping:** Staff Software Engineer at CyberArk maps to E6 (Staff) in the Palo Alto Networks engineering ladder, senior IC with org-wide architectural influence within the Identity Security business unit.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

The **$25B** acquisition of CyberArk by **Palo Alto Networks**, completed on **Feb 11, 2026**, elevated identity security from a standalone product category to a foundational platform capability. CyberArk's **Identity-First Connectivity** positioning within PANW means that staff engineers are designing the identity fabric that connects every PANW product — from Prisma to Cortex to Strata. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and your architectural decisions directly impact the value of that equity.

Staff-level candidates should use this lever aggressively: the $25B valuation was predicated on successful platform integration, and that integration is architecturally led by staff engineers. Frame every negotiation around the fact that Palo Alto Networks cannot deliver on its Identity-First Connectivity roadmap without retaining and attracting staff-level identity security architects. This makes you a high-leverage negotiator — act like it.

#### Global Levers

**1. Architectural Ownership Lever**
> "At the staff level, I'll be making architectural decisions that determine how CyberArk's identity security stack integrates with PANW's platform. These decisions are irreversible and high-impact. I expect compensation that reflects the scope and permanence of my architectural influence across the Identity-First Connectivity platform."

**2. PANW RSU Scale Lever**
> "Given the $25B acquisition and PANW's investment in CyberArk as a strategic platform pillar, staff-level RSU grants should reflect the outsized value creation potential. I'm looking at $250K/yr in PANW RSUs, consistent with what E6 staff engineers receive at PANW for platform-critical roles."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I'm evaluating a staff engineer offer from [Palo Alto Networks direct / CrowdStrike / Datadog] at $550K total comp. CyberArk's Identity-First Connectivity mission is uniquely compelling, but the total package needs to be competitive at the staff level. I'd like to close the gap primarily through RSUs."

**4. Retention & Integration Premium Lever**
> "Post-acquisition integration requires staff-level stability. I'd like to discuss a supplemental retention RSU grant or a one-time integration bonus that recognizes the critical nature of the first 18–24 months post-close. This is standard practice for PANW-level acquisitions."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $235K base + $250K/yr PANW RSUs ($1M over 4 years) + $60K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $200K base with $160K/yr RSUs, counter by referencing PANW E6 Levels.fyi data (median ~$530K TC) and your competing CrowdStrike staff offer at $540K TC. Emphasize that architectural leadership during the integration phase commands a premium. Your accept-at floor should be $215K base + $190K/yr PANW RSUs + $40K signing bonus, yielding ~$455K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪740K base + ₪780K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £140K base + £170K/yr PANW RSUs.
