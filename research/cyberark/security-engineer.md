#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at CyberArk build and harden the security infrastructure that protects privileged credentials, secrets, and identity systems for thousands of enterprises worldwide. This is a company where security engineers literally build security products — the expertise required spans offensive security (red teaming, penetration testing), defensive security (threat detection, incident response), and identity security (credential management, access governance). Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, security engineers at CyberArk now contribute to the security posture of the entire PANW platform. The Identity-First Connectivity vision requires that CyberArk's identity security layer meets the exacting security standards of the world's largest cybersecurity company.

**Level Mapping:** Security Engineer at CyberArk maps to E3–E5 in the Palo Alto Networks security engineering ladder, IC contributor within the Identity Security product security team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

When **Palo Alto Networks** completed its **$25B** acquisition of CyberArk on **Feb 11, 2026**, it brought two world-class security organizations together. CyberArk's **Identity-First Connectivity** platform is now a critical component of PANW's security posture — and the security engineers who protect that platform bear enormous responsibility. A vulnerability in CyberArk's identity layer could impact every PANW customer. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and the security of the platform you protect directly impacts customer trust and stock price.

Use this in negotiations: Security engineers at CyberArk protect the products that protect the world's most sensitive credentials. Post-acquisition, the blast radius of any security issue has expanded to the entire PANW platform. This elevated responsibility demands elevated compensation. Frame your role as the last line of defense for the $25B Identity-First Connectivity investment.

#### Global Levers

**1. Security-of-Security Products Lever**
> "I'm a security engineer working on security products — this is the highest-stakes security engineering work in the industry. A vulnerability in CyberArk's privileged access management or identity security products would have catastrophic downstream impact on PANW's customer base. I'd expect compensation that reflects this uniquely elevated responsibility."

**2. PANW Platform Security Impact Lever**
> "Post-acquisition, CyberArk's identity layer is embedded across the PANW platform. My security work now protects not just CyberArk customers, but the entire PANW ecosystem. I'd like an RSU grant that reflects this expanded blast radius and the direct impact of my work on PANW's brand and revenue."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I'm evaluating security engineering offers from [CrowdStrike / Google Project Zero / Trail of Bits / NCC Group] in the $350K total comp range. CyberArk's security challenges within PANW are uniquely interesting, but the compensation needs to compete with top-tier security engineering roles."

**4. Identity Security Specialization Lever**
> "Identity security is the fastest-growing attack surface in enterprise security. My expertise in [privileged access security / credential hardening / identity threat detection] is directly aligned with CyberArk's core mission and is in extremely high demand across the industry. I'd expect a specialization premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180K base + $130K/yr PANW RSUs ($520K over 4 years) + $35K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $150K base with $75K/yr RSUs, counter by citing the security-of-security-products premium and your competing CrowdStrike offer at $340K TC. Emphasize the elevated blast radius post-acquisition and your identity security specialization. Your accept-at floor should be $165K base + $95K/yr PANW RSUs + $20K signing bonus, yielding ~$295K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪550K base + ₪400K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £100K base + £85K/yr PANW RSUs.
