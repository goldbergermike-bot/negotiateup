#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at CyberArk lead teams building privileged access management, identity security, and secrets management products. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, engineering managers face the dual challenge of maintaining team velocity on existing products while navigating integration into the PANW engineering organization. This makes EM roles exceptionally demanding — and exceptionally valuable. CyberArk EMs are responsible for retaining critical engineering talent through the transition, aligning roadmaps with PANW platform strategy, and delivering on the Identity-First Connectivity vision. Candidates should negotiate for both the complexity of the role and the retention imperative.

**Level Mapping:** Engineering Manager at CyberArk maps to M1–M2 in the Palo Alto Networks management ladder, people manager leading a team of 6–12 engineers within the Identity Security business unit.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

The **Palo Alto Networks** acquisition, completed on **Feb 11, 2026** at **$25B**, has made engineering management at CyberArk one of the most strategically important roles in the combined organization. **Identity-First Connectivity** is PANW's stated strategic priority for the CyberArk subsidiary, and engineering managers are the ones responsible for delivering on that promise. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), directly tying your compensation to the success of the integration you are leading.

Use this in negotiations: EMs who can retain teams, align roadmaps, and deliver integration milestones are the highest-priority hires in any post-acquisition environment. The $25B valuation means PANW has enormous financial incentive to ensure CyberArk's engineering organization remains stable and productive. You are the person responsible for making that happen — price yourself accordingly.

#### Global Levers

**1. Team Retention Lever**
> "Post-acquisition engineering management is fundamentally about retention. I know PANW invested $25B in CyberArk, and a significant portion of that value walks out the door if key engineers leave. My track record of retaining high-performers through organizational transitions directly protects PANW's investment, and I'd expect my compensation to reflect that responsibility."

**2. PANW RSU Management Premium Lever**
> "Engineering managers at PANW-tier companies typically receive RSU grants that reflect both their direct impact and their team's output multiplier. I'd like to discuss a grant of $180K/yr in PANW RSUs, consistent with PANW M1–M2 benchmarks for teams working on strategic platform priorities like Identity-First Connectivity."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have an EM offer from [CrowdStrike / Fortinet / Okta] at $460K total comp. CyberArk's integration into PANW is a uniquely interesting leadership challenge, but I need the package to compete. Can we close the gap through a combination of RSUs and a signing bonus?"

**4. Scope Expansion Lever**
> "Given that this EM role will likely expand in scope as CyberArk's identity security teams integrate with PANW's broader engineering org, I'd like to discuss a compensation review trigger at the 12-month mark tied to team size and cross-functional responsibility growth."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $220K base + $180K/yr PANW RSUs ($720K over 4 years) + $50K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $185K base with $110K/yr RSUs, counter by emphasizing the EM retention multiplier effect and referencing PANW M1-M2 comp data from Levels.fyi (median ~$440K TC). Cite your competing Fortinet EM offer at $450K TC. Your accept-at floor should be $200K base + $140K/yr PANW RSUs + $30K signing bonus, yielding ~$380K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪680K base + ₪560K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £130K base + £120K/yr PANW RSUs.
