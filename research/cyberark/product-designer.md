#### Negotiation DNA

Product Designers at CyberArk shape the user experience for identity security and privileged access management products used by security teams at the world's largest enterprises. Following the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, designers face a unique challenge: unifying CyberArk's design language with PANW's broader platform UX while preserving the specialized workflows that security practitioners depend on. Identity security UX is notoriously complex — designers who can simplify credential vaulting, session management, and identity governance workflows are in very high demand. The Identity-First Connectivity vision requires seamless UX across the PANW platform, making design a critical function.

**Level Mapping:** Product Designer at CyberArk maps to D3–D4 in the Palo Alto Networks design organization, mid-to-senior IC designer within the Identity Security product design team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

With **Palo Alto Networks** completing its **$25B** acquisition of CyberArk on **Feb 11, 2026**, the design organization is tasked with creating a unified **Identity-First Connectivity** experience that works seamlessly within the broader PANW platform. This is a significant design challenge — CyberArk's products are deeply technical, and the users (security operations teams, identity administrators) have specialized workflow needs. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), connecting your financial outcomes to the success of the platform experience you design.

Leverage this in negotiations: Design is often undervalued in security companies, but the $25B acquisition means PANW expects CyberArk to reach a much larger user base. Scaling to that audience requires exceptional UX — and exceptional UX requires exceptional designers. Position yourself as the person who makes Identity-First Connectivity accessible and intuitive for PANW's enterprise customer base.

#### Global Levers

**1. Security UX Specialization Lever**
> "Designing for identity security and privileged access management requires deep domain knowledge — understanding credential rotation workflows, session recording interfaces, and identity governance dashboards. This is a specialized design skill that's hard to find. I'd expect compensation that reflects the rarity of security-focused product design expertise."

**2. Platform Unification Design Lever**
> "Post-acquisition, I'll be responsible for unifying CyberArk's design system with PANW's platform UX standards. This is high-visibility work that directly impacts product adoption across the Identity-First Connectivity platform. I'd like an RSU package that reflects the cross-platform impact of this design work."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have a product designer offer from [Figma / CrowdStrike / Datadog] at $290K total comp. While CyberArk's design challenges within the PANW ecosystem are uniquely compelling, I need the total package to be competitive. Can we discuss increasing the RSU component?"

**4. Design System Integration Premium Lever**
> "Merging two enterprise design systems post-acquisition is one of the most challenging design projects there is. I bring experience with [design system migration / enterprise UX / security product design] that directly applies to the CyberArk-PANW integration. This expertise warrants a premium."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $160K base + $100K/yr PANW RSUs ($400K over 4 years) + $25K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $135K base with $60K/yr RSUs, counter by citing security UX design scarcity and your competing Datadog offer at $280K TC. Emphasize the design system unification challenge and your relevant experience. Your accept-at floor should be $145K base + $75K/yr PANW RSUs + $15K signing bonus, yielding ~$245K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪475K base + ₪310K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £88K base + £68K/yr PANW RSUs.
