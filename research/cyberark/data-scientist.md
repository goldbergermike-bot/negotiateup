#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at CyberArk apply statistical modeling, machine learning, and behavioral analytics to identity security challenges — detecting anomalous access patterns, predicting credential compromise, and quantifying identity risk across enterprise environments. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, CyberArk data scientists now have access to PANW's massive security telemetry dataset, dramatically expanding the scope and impact of their work. The Identity-First Connectivity platform requires data-driven identity intelligence, making data science a high-priority function in the combined organization.

**Level Mapping:** Data Scientist at CyberArk maps to DS3–DS4 in the Palo Alto Networks data science organization, mid-to-senior IC data scientist within the Identity Security analytics team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

**Palo Alto Networks** completed its **$25B** acquisition of CyberArk on **Feb 11, 2026**, creating an unprecedented opportunity for data scientists. CyberArk's **Identity-First Connectivity** platform, combined with PANW's security telemetry from Cortex, Prisma, and Strata, offers one of the largest and most diverse security datasets in the industry. Data scientists at CyberArk can now build identity analytics models that draw on PANW's global threat intelligence, making their work dramatically more impactful. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), connecting your compensation to the combined platform's growth.

Use this in negotiations: The combination of CyberArk's identity-specific data with PANW's broader security telemetry is a unique data science opportunity. Position yourself as someone who can bridge identity analytics with platform-scale threat detection, and demand compensation that reflects this expanded scope.

#### Global Levers

**1. Security Data Science Scarcity Lever**
> "Data scientists with identity security domain expertise — understanding privileged access patterns, credential abuse detection, and identity risk scoring — are extremely rare. My background in [behavioral analytics / anomaly detection / identity risk modeling] directly maps to CyberArk's core analytical needs. I'd expect compensation that reflects this specialized skill set."

**2. PANW Data Scale Lever**
> "With access to PANW's combined security telemetry post-acquisition, the scope of data science work at CyberArk has expanded dramatically. My models will now influence identity security decisions across the entire PANW platform. I'd like an RSU grant that reflects this expanded impact — $120K/yr in PANW RSUs is appropriate for platform-scale data science."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I'm evaluating data science offers from [CrowdStrike / Splunk / Snowflake / Databricks] in the $330K total comp range. CyberArk's identity analytics challenge within PANW is uniquely compelling, but I need the compensation to be competitive with these alternatives."

**4. Cross-Platform Analytics Lever**
> "Post-acquisition, I can build identity analytics that integrate with Cortex XDR, Prisma Access, and the broader PANW detection engine. This cross-platform analytical capability is the key to realizing the Identity-First Connectivity vision. I'd like to discuss a compensation package that reflects this cross-platform impact."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $175K base + $120K/yr PANW RSUs ($480K over 4 years) + $30K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $150K base with $70K/yr RSUs, counter by referencing PANW DS3-DS4 compensation bands and your competing Databricks offer at $320K TC. Highlight the unique opportunity of combining CyberArk identity data with PANW telemetry and your relevant domain experience. Your accept-at floor should be $160K base + $90K/yr PANW RSUs + $20K signing bonus, yielding ~$280K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪540K base + ₪380K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £98K base + £80K/yr PANW RSUs.
