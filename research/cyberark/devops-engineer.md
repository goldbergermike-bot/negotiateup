#### Negotiation DNA

DevOps Engineers at CyberArk build and maintain the CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and deployment systems that power identity security products across cloud and on-premise environments. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, DevOps engineers face a massive infrastructure integration challenge: merging CyberArk's build and deployment systems with PANW's platform infrastructure, migrating services to PANW's cloud-native architecture, and ensuring zero-downtime continuity for enterprise customers. The Identity-First Connectivity platform requires infrastructure that can scale to PANW's global customer base, making DevOps a critical enabler of the acquisition's success.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at CyberArk maps to E3–E5 in the Palo Alto Networks infrastructure engineering ladder, IC contributor within the Identity Security platform infrastructure team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

Following the **$25B** acquisition by **Palo Alto Networks**, completed on **Feb 11, 2026**, DevOps engineers are at the front lines of infrastructure integration. CyberArk's **Identity-First Connectivity** platform must be deployed and operated at PANW scale — meaning infrastructure that supports millions of identity operations per second across global regions. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and the reliability and scalability of the infrastructure you build directly impacts platform revenue.

Leverage this in negotiations: Infrastructure integration is the unglamorous but essential work that makes or breaks a $25B acquisition. If CyberArk's products can't deploy reliably on PANW's infrastructure, the Identity-First Connectivity vision fails. DevOps engineers who can bridge both infrastructure environments are in high demand and short supply. Price yourself as the person who ensures the technical foundation of the acquisition holds up.

#### Global Levers

**1. Infrastructure Integration Complexity Lever**
> "Merging CyberArk's deployment infrastructure with PANW's platform requires deep expertise in both environments. I'll be responsible for CI/CD pipeline integration, service migration, and infrastructure-as-code unification. This is high-complexity, high-stakes work that demands competitive compensation."

**2. PANW Scale Operations Lever**
> "Operating at PANW scale means my infrastructure decisions impact millions of customers and billions of identity operations. I'd like an RSU package that reflects the operational scale and the direct link between infrastructure reliability and PANW platform revenue."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have a DevOps engineer offer from [HashiCorp / Datadog / AWS] at $310K total comp. While the CyberArk infrastructure integration challenge within PANW is technically exciting, I need the package to be competitive. Can we bridge the gap with additional PANW RSUs?"

**4. Cloud-Native Migration Premium Lever**
> "Post-acquisition, there's likely a significant cloud-native migration effort underway. My experience with [Kubernetes / Terraform / cloud-native architecture] directly applies to migrating CyberArk services to PANW's infrastructure patterns. This migration expertise warrants a premium over standard DevOps compensation."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $170K base + $110K/yr PANW RSUs ($440K over 4 years) + $28K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $145K base with $65K/yr RSUs, counter by citing the infrastructure integration premium for post-acquisition DevOps roles and your competing HashiCorp offer at $305K TC. Emphasize your cloud-native and infrastructure-as-code experience. Your accept-at floor should be $155K base + $80K/yr PANW RSUs + $18K signing bonus, yielding ~$260K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪510K base + ₪340K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £92K base + £72K/yr PANW RSUs.
