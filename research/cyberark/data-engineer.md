#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at CyberArk build the data pipelines, warehouses, and real-time streaming infrastructure that powers identity analytics, security telemetry, and privileged access intelligence. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, data engineers face a transformative challenge: integrating CyberArk's identity-centric data infrastructure with PANW's massive security data platform spanning Cortex Data Lake, threat intelligence feeds, and cross-product telemetry. The Identity-First Connectivity vision requires a unified data layer that connects identity signals across the entire PANW platform, making data engineering a foundational capability.

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at CyberArk maps to E3–E5 in the Palo Alto Networks data engineering ladder, IC contributor within the Identity Security data platform team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

The **$25B** acquisition by **Palo Alto Networks**, completed **Feb 11, 2026**, has created an unprecedented data integration challenge. CyberArk's **Identity-First Connectivity** platform generates massive volumes of identity event data — privileged session logs, credential access patterns, identity governance decisions — that must now flow into PANW's Cortex Data Lake and analytics infrastructure. Data engineers are responsible for building the pipes that connect these two data ecosystems. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and the data infrastructure you build determines how effectively the combined platform can detect identity-based threats.

Use this in negotiations: The $25B acquisition value partly reflects the data synergies between CyberArk's identity telemetry and PANW's security data lake. Data engineers who can architect the data integration layer are directly enabling the acquisition thesis. Without unified identity data flowing through the PANW platform, the Identity-First Connectivity vision is incomplete. Position yourself as the builder of that critical data bridge.

#### Global Levers

**1. Data Integration Architecture Lever**
> "Integrating CyberArk's identity data pipelines with PANW's Cortex Data Lake is one of the most impactful data engineering challenges in cybersecurity. I'll be building the data infrastructure that enables cross-platform identity analytics — a core pillar of the Identity-First Connectivity vision. I'd expect compensation that reflects the architectural scope and strategic importance of this work."

**2. Real-Time Identity Data Processing Lever**
> "Identity security requires real-time data processing — credential abuse detection, session anomaly alerting, and identity risk scoring all depend on millisecond-latency pipelines. My experience with [Kafka / Flink / Spark Streaming / real-time data infrastructure] directly enables CyberArk's real-time identity capabilities. This real-time data expertise commands a premium."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have a data engineering offer from [Databricks / Snowflake / CrowdStrike / Confluent] at $315K total comp. CyberArk's data integration challenge within PANW is technically exciting, but I need the package to compete. Can we close the gap with additional PANW RSUs?"

**4. Security Data Domain Expertise Lever**
> "Data engineering in the security domain requires understanding of threat intelligence schemas, security event formats, and compliance data requirements. My experience with [SIEM data / security telemetry / compliance data pipelines] gives me a domain advantage that general data engineers don't have. I'd expect a domain expertise premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $170K base + $115K/yr PANW RSUs ($460K over 4 years) + $28K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $145K base with $65K/yr RSUs, counter by citing the data integration premium for post-acquisition roles and your competing Databricks offer at $310K TC. Emphasize your real-time streaming and security data domain experience. Your accept-at floor should be $155K base + $85K/yr PANW RSUs + $18K signing bonus, yielding ~$265K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪515K base + ₪360K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £92K base + £75K/yr PANW RSUs.
