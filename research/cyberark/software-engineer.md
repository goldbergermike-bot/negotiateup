#### Global Levers

**1. Identity Security Scarcity Lever**
> "Engineers with identity security and privileged access management experience are in the top 5% of cybersecurity talent. My background in [credential vaulting / secrets management / identity governance] directly maps to CyberArk's core product, and I'd expect compensation to reflect the scarcity of this skillset."

**2. Post-Acquisition Equity Appreciation Lever**
> "With the PANW acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026, at a $25B valuation, CyberArk engineers now hold PANW RSUs with significant upside potential. I'd like to discuss an RSU grant that reflects the strategic importance of the Identity-First Connectivity platform within Palo Alto Networks."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I'm currently evaluating offers from [CrowdStrike / Zscaler / Okta] in the identity and security space. While I'm genuinely excited about CyberArk's role within PANW, I need the total compensation to be competitive with these alternatives."

**4. Geographic Arbitrage Lever**
> "Given CyberArk's presence in Newton MA, Tel Aviv, and London, I'd like to discuss how my location factors into the overall package. I'm aware that PANW applies geo-differential bands, and I want to ensure my offer reflects the cost of living and talent market in my region."
