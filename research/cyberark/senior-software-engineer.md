#### Negotiation DNA

Senior Software Engineers at CyberArk are the technical backbone of privileged access management and identity security products that now sit at the center of Palo Alto Networks' security platform strategy. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition closed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, senior engineers carry outsized influence — they are responsible for integrating CyberArk's identity security stack into the PANW platform while maintaining product velocity. Candidates at this level should negotiate aggressively, as PANW needs experienced CyberArk-domain engineers to execute on the Identity-First Connectivity vision and retain institutional knowledge through the integration period.

**Level Mapping:** Senior Software Engineer at CyberArk maps to E5 in the Palo Alto Networks engineering ladder, senior IC contributor with cross-team influence within the Identity Security business unit.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

The **Palo Alto Networks** acquisition of CyberArk, completed on **Feb 11, 2026** at a **$25B** valuation, has positioned CyberArk as the **Identity-First Connectivity** pillar within PANW's broader platformization strategy. Senior engineers are directly responsible for making this integration successful — from API unification to shared identity fabric across PANW products. Your equity is granted as **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), meaning your financial upside is tied to the success of the combined entity.

Leverage this in negotiations: The $25B price tag demonstrates that Palo Alto Networks views identity security as a must-have, not a nice-to-have. Senior engineers who can navigate both legacy CyberArk architecture and new PANW platform patterns are exceptionally rare. Frame your experience as integration-critical and demand compensation that reflects retention priority during this pivotal transition.

#### Global Levers

**1. Integration Complexity Lever**
> "As a senior engineer joining during the post-acquisition integration phase, I'll be responsible for unifying CyberArk's identity security stack with PANW's platform. This is high-stakes, technically complex work that demands senior-level compensation. I'd expect a package that reflects both the urgency and the difficulty of this integration."

**2. PANW RSU Upside Lever**
> "With CyberArk now part of Palo Alto Networks following the $25B acquisition completed Feb 11, 2026, I'm excited about the PANW RSU equity component. Given the strategic value of Identity-First Connectivity to PANW's roadmap, I'd like to negotiate an RSU grant that reflects my ability to directly impact platform revenue."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have a competing senior engineer offer from [CrowdStrike / Okta / HashiCorp] at $380K total comp. While CyberArk's position within PANW is compelling, I need the package to be at least competitive with what's on the table. Can we discuss bridging the gap on RSUs?"

**4. Retention Risk Lever**
> "Post-acquisition is a critical retention period, and I know PANW is prioritizing keeping senior talent. I'd like to discuss a retention grant or accelerated vesting cliff to reflect the importance of continuity during the Identity-First Connectivity platform build-out."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $190K base + $140K/yr PANW RSUs ($560K over 4 years) + $40K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $165K base with $90K/yr RSUs, counter with evidence from Levels.fyi showing PANW E5 median at $185K base + $120K/yr RSUs and cite your competing CrowdStrike offer at $375K TC. Your accept-at floor should be $175K base + $110K/yr PANW RSUs + $25K signing bonus, yielding ~$320K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪580K base + ₪420K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £105K base + £90K/yr PANW RSUs.
