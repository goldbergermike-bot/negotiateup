#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at CyberArk coordinate complex, cross-functional engineering programs spanning identity security, privileged access management, and secrets management. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, TPMs are arguably the most critical coordination function in the organization. They are responsible for driving integration milestones, managing cross-team dependencies between CyberArk and PANW engineering organizations, and ensuring the Identity-First Connectivity platform ships on schedule. Post-acquisition TPMs operate in high-ambiguity, high-stakes environments where program execution directly determines whether the $25B investment delivers value.

**Level Mapping:** Technical Program Manager at CyberArk maps to TPM3–TPM4 in the Palo Alto Networks TPM organization, mid-to-senior program manager within the Identity Security integration program.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

**Palo Alto Networks** completed its **$25B** acquisition of CyberArk on **Feb 11, 2026**, launching one of the most complex integration programs in cybersecurity industry history. TPMs are the operational backbone of this integration, driving the **Identity-First Connectivity** platform from vision to execution. From API integration timelines to shared infrastructure milestones, TPMs define the pace of value realization. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and the efficiency with which you execute integration programs directly impacts PANW's ability to realize the $25B acquisition thesis.

Leverage this in negotiations: Post-acquisition integration is the single highest-risk phase for any acquired company, and TPMs are the risk mitigators. The $25B price tag means PANW leadership is watching integration milestones closely, and the person who keeps those milestones on track is invaluable. Frame yourself as the person who de-risks the acquisition and demand compensation accordingly.

#### Global Levers

**1. Integration Program Complexity Lever**
> "Post-acquisition integration TPM work is among the most challenging program management in the industry. I'll be coordinating across CyberArk and PANW engineering organizations, managing competing priorities, resolving cross-organizational dependencies, and driving milestones that PANW's executive team is tracking weekly. This is not standard TPM work — it's integration-critical, and I'd expect compensation to reflect that."

**2. PANW RSU Integration Impact Lever**
> "My program execution directly impacts how quickly CyberArk realizes its value within PANW. Every integration milestone I hit accelerates revenue from the Identity-First Connectivity platform. I'd like an RSU package of $125K/yr in PANW RSUs that reflects the direct link between my program delivery and PANW's financial outcomes."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have a TPM offer from [Google / Amazon / Microsoft] at $350K total comp. The CyberArk integration challenge within PANW is a uniquely high-impact TPM opportunity, but I need the package to be competitive with what Big Tech is offering. Can we discuss bridging the gap?"

**4. Cross-Organizational Coordination Premium Lever**
> "Coordinating across two engineering organizations — each with different tools, processes, and cultures — requires exceptional program management skills. My experience with [post-acquisition integration / cross-org program management / large-scale platform migration] directly applies. This cross-organizational expertise warrants a premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $185K base + $125K/yr PANW RSUs ($500K over 4 years) + $35K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $155K base with $75K/yr RSUs, counter by citing the post-acquisition integration premium and your competing Amazon TPM offer at $340K TC. Emphasize your cross-organizational program management experience and the strategic visibility of the integration program. Your accept-at floor should be $165K base + $95K/yr PANW RSUs + $22K signing bonus, yielding ~$295K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪565K base + ₪390K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £105K base + £82K/yr PANW RSUs.
