#### Negotiation DNA

ML/AI Engineers at CyberArk develop machine learning models and AI systems that power identity threat detection, behavioral analytics, anomaly scoring, and intelligent access governance. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, ML/AI engineers at CyberArk now have access to PANW's massive security dataset and advanced AI research capabilities, dramatically expanding the scope of what's possible in identity-focused AI. The Identity-First Connectivity platform relies on AI to connect identity signals across products in real time, making ML/AI engineering one of the most strategically important functions in the combined organization. AI talent commands premium compensation across the industry, and CyberArk/PANW must compete for this talent against Big Tech, AI-native startups, and well-funded security companies.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at CyberArk maps to E4–E5 (ML) in the Palo Alto Networks AI/ML engineering ladder, mid-to-senior IC ML engineer within the Identity Security AI team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

**Palo Alto Networks** completed its **$25B** acquisition of CyberArk on **Feb 11, 2026**, and AI/ML is the connective tissue that makes the **Identity-First Connectivity** vision work. CyberArk's identity data — privileged session behaviors, credential usage patterns, identity lifecycle events — combined with PANW's network and endpoint telemetry, creates an AI training dataset that no other security company can match. ML/AI engineers at CyberArk build the models that turn this data into actionable identity intelligence. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and the AI capabilities you build directly differentiate the platform in the market.

Leverage this aggressively in negotiations: AI/ML talent is the scarcest and most expensive engineering talent in the industry. The $25B acquisition thesis depends on AI-powered identity intelligence to differentiate PANW's platform from competitors. You are building the AI layer that justifies the acquisition premium. Every competing offer you hold — whether from OpenAI, Google, or CrowdStrike — is a legitimate negotiation lever because PANW cannot realize the Identity-First Connectivity vision without AI talent.

#### Global Levers

**1. AI Talent Scarcity Lever**
> "ML/AI engineers with security domain expertise are among the rarest talent in tech. My combination of [deep learning / NLP / anomaly detection] skills with identity security domain knowledge directly maps to CyberArk's AI roadmap. I'm actively being recruited by Big Tech AI labs and well-funded AI startups. I'd expect compensation that reflects this extreme talent scarcity."

**2. PANW AI Platform Impact Lever**
> "The AI models I build at CyberArk will power identity threat detection across the entire PANW platform — serving millions of customers globally. This is not a research project; it's production AI at platform scale. I'd like an RSU grant of $150K/yr in PANW RSUs that reflects the revenue impact of AI-powered identity intelligence."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I have competing ML/AI offers from [Google Brain / OpenAI / CrowdStrike / Anthropic] in the $400K–$500K total comp range. CyberArk's identity AI challenge within PANW is uniquely compelling from a research and impact perspective, but the compensation needs to be competitive with top-tier AI roles. Let's discuss how to close the gap."

**4. Identity AI Research Premium Lever**
> "Identity-focused AI — behavioral biometrics, privileged access anomaly detection, identity risk scoring — is an emerging research frontier. My publications and experience in [identity behavioral analytics / credential abuse detection / AI-driven access governance] position me to lead this research direction at CyberArk. I'd expect a research premium in both base salary and RSU grant."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $195K base + $150K/yr PANW RSUs ($600K over 4 years) + $40K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $165K base with $90K/yr RSUs, counter aggressively by citing AI talent market rates from Levels.fyi (PANW ML E5 median ~$400K TC) and your competing Google/CrowdStrike ML offer at $450K TC. Emphasize the AI talent war and the strategic importance of identity AI to the $25B acquisition thesis. Your accept-at floor should be $180K base + $120K/yr PANW RSUs + $30K signing bonus, yielding ~$345K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪600K base + ₪480K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £115K base + £100K/yr PANW RSUs.
