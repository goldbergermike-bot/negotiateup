#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at CyberArk design and validate identity security architectures for the world's largest enterprises, bridging technical depth with customer-facing consultative skills. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, solutions architects play a critical go-to-market role: they are the technical experts who help enterprise customers understand how CyberArk's privileged access management and identity governance capabilities integrate with the broader PANW security platform. The Identity-First Connectivity positioning means SAs must articulate a cross-platform value proposition that spans Cortex, Prisma, Strata, and CyberArk's identity stack.

**Level Mapping:** Solutions Architect at CyberArk maps to SA2–SA3 in the Palo Alto Networks solutions architecture organization, customer-facing technical IC within the Identity Security go-to-market team.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

The **Palo Alto Networks** acquisition, completed **Feb 11, 2026** at **$25B**, has fundamentally expanded the solutions architect role at CyberArk. SAs no longer sell standalone identity security — they architect end-to-end **Identity-First Connectivity** solutions that span the entire PANW platform. This expansion in scope is a direct negotiation lever. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), and every deal you help close contributes to the revenue growth that drives PANW's stock price.

Use this in negotiations: Solutions Architects who can credibly present the combined CyberArk + PANW platform story are the tip of the revenue spear. The $25B acquisition will only deliver returns if enterprise customers adopt Identity-First Connectivity at scale, and that adoption is driven by SAs in customer meetings. Frame your role as revenue-critical, not just technical, and demand compensation that reflects both the technical depth and the commercial impact.

#### Global Levers

**1. Cross-Platform Technical Selling Lever**
> "As a solutions architect covering the combined CyberArk + PANW platform, I'll be architecting solutions that span identity security, network security, and cloud security. This cross-platform scope is significantly broader than a standalone CyberArk SA role. I'd expect compensation that reflects the expanded technical and commercial responsibility."

**2. Revenue Influence Lever**
> "Solutions Architects directly influence deal size and close rates. My ability to architect and validate Identity-First Connectivity solutions for enterprise customers will drive revenue that justifies the $25B acquisition. I'd like to discuss an RSU package and variable compensation structure that reflects this revenue influence."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I'm evaluating SA offers from [CrowdStrike / Zscaler / Palo Alto Networks direct] at $370K total comp. CyberArk's combined platform story within PANW is the most technically compelling opportunity, but the total package needs to compete. Can we increase the RSU component?"

**4. Enterprise Customer Relationships Lever**
> "I bring established relationships with [Fortune 500 / Global 2000] enterprises who are current CyberArk customers. These relationships accelerate cross-sell and upsell motions for the Identity-First Connectivity platform. My existing customer book has tangible revenue value that should be reflected in my compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $190K base + $130K/yr PANW RSUs ($520K over 4 years) + $40K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $160K base with $80K/yr RSUs, counter by citing the expanded cross-platform scope and your competing Zscaler SA offer at $360K TC. Emphasize your enterprise customer relationships and cross-platform architecture skills. Your accept-at floor should be $170K base + $100K/yr PANW RSUs + $25K signing bonus, yielding ~$310K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪580K base + ₪400K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £110K base + £85K/yr PANW RSUs.
