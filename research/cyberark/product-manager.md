#### Negotiation DNA

Product Managers at CyberArk own the roadmap for identity security and privileged access management products that serve thousands of enterprise customers worldwide. Since the Palo Alto Networks acquisition completed on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, CyberArk PMs face a pivotal mandate: define how CyberArk's products integrate into the PANW platform while preserving the identity security depth that made CyberArk the market leader. This requires deep domain expertise in privileged access, identity governance, and secrets management, combined with the ability to navigate cross-organizational product strategy. The Identity-First Connectivity positioning means CyberArk PMs are shaping one of PANW's highest-priority product bets.

**Level Mapping:** Product Manager at CyberArk maps to PM2–PM3 in the Palo Alto Networks product organization, individual contributor PM within the Identity Security product line.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

Since **Palo Alto Networks** completed its acquisition of CyberArk on **Feb 11, 2026** at a **$25B** valuation, Product Managers are at the epicenter of strategic decisions. CyberArk's **Identity-First Connectivity** platform is a cornerstone of PANW's platformization thesis — and PMs define what gets built. Your equity is **PANW** RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), meaning every product decision you make impacts your own equity value and the combined company's market position.

Use this context to negotiate: PMs who can bridge CyberArk's deep identity security domain expertise with PANW's platform scale are rare. The $25B acquisition price reflects enormous expectations for the Identity-First Connectivity platform, and those expectations flow through your product roadmap. Frame yourself as the person who translates that $25B investment into actual product outcomes.

#### Global Levers

**1. Platform Integration Product Strategy Lever**
> "As a PM joining during the PANW integration, I'll be making product decisions that define how CyberArk's identity security capabilities become platform features for all of PANW's customers. These are high-leverage, high-visibility decisions. I'd expect compensation that reflects the strategic importance and the irreversibility of product integration choices."

**2. PANW RSU Impact Lever**
> "My product decisions will directly influence CyberArk's revenue contribution to PANW. Given the $25B acquisition valuation, even a 1% improvement in identity security product adoption across the PANW customer base translates to hundreds of millions in value. I'd like an RSU package that reflects this product-level impact."

**3. Competing Offer Lever**
> "I'm considering PM roles at [CrowdStrike / Zscaler / Okta / SailPoint] with total compensation in the $350K range. CyberArk's position within PANW is the most strategically interesting opportunity, but the offer needs to be competitive at the PM level."

**4. Domain Expertise Premium Lever**
> "Identity security and privileged access management is a highly specialized product domain. My experience with [PAM / identity governance / zero trust architecture] is directly applicable to CyberArk's product roadmap and difficult to find in the PM market. I'd expect a domain expertise premium in both base and RSUs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Open at $180K base + $130K/yr PANW RSUs ($520K over 4 years) + $35K signing bonus for Newton MA. If the initial offer comes in at $155K base with $80K/yr RSUs, counter by citing the PANW PM2-PM3 compensation bands from Levels.fyi and your competing offer from Zscaler at $340K TC. Emphasize your identity security domain expertise and the strategic importance of the PM role during integration. Your accept-at floor should be $165K base + $100K/yr PANW RSUs + $20K signing bonus, yielding ~$295K total Year 1 comp. In Tel Aviv, target ₪550K base + ₪400K/yr PANW RSUs. In London, target £100K base + £85K/yr PANW RSUs.
