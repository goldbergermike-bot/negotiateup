### Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineer | CyberArk Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** CyberArk (acquired by Palo Alto Networks) | Identity-First Connectivity Platform | Privileged Access Management & Identity Security | Post-Acquisition PANW Equity | Newton MA, Tel Aviv, London

---

#### Role Overview

The Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineer is CyberArk's signature engineering role — purpose-built for the post-acquisition era. These engineers design, build, and scale the Identity-First Connectivity platform that sits at the center of Palo Alto Networks' security architecture. This role bridges CyberArk's deep expertise in privileged access management (PAM), identity governance, secrets management, and endpoint privilege management with PANW's platform-scale infrastructure spanning Cortex, Prisma, and Strata.

Following the completion of the Palo Alto Networks acquisition on Feb 11, 2026 at a $25B valuation, the Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineer role represents the highest-leverage engineering position in the combined organization. These engineers own the APIs, microservices, and identity fabric that connect every PANW product to CyberArk's identity intelligence layer. Without this role, the $25B acquisition thesis — that identity is the foundation of next-generation security — cannot be realized.

This guide is intentionally the most detailed in the CyberArk series because this role sits at the intersection of the acquisition's technical, strategic, and financial outcomes. Negotiation leverage is exceptionally high.

#### Negotiation DNA

Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineers are the architects and builders of CyberArk's most strategically important technical asset: the identity fabric that connects privileged access management, identity governance, secrets management, and endpoint privilege management into a unified platform layer within Palo Alto Networks. This role was born from the acquisition — when Palo Alto Networks completed its $25B acquisition of CyberArk on Feb 11, 2026, the immediate technical priority was building the connective tissue between CyberArk's identity depth and PANW's platform breadth.

The Identity-First Connectivity platform is not a peripheral feature — it is the strategic rationale for the acquisition. PANW CEO Nikesh Arora has publicly stated that identity is the next frontier of platformization, and CyberArk's technology is the foundation. Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineers sit at the exact intersection of this vision and its technical execution. Every API they design, every microservice they deploy, and every identity protocol they implement shapes how 80,000+ PANW customers interact with identity security.

Candidates negotiating for this role should understand three key dynamics:

1. **Supply-demand imbalance:** Engineers who understand both CyberArk's identity stack (PAM, identity governance, secrets management) AND platform-scale distributed systems are extraordinarily rare. There are perhaps a few hundred engineers globally who qualify.

2. **Acquisition thesis dependency:** The $25B valuation assumes successful platform integration. If the Identity-First Connectivity platform fails to materialize, the acquisition fails. This gives platform engineers enormous leverage.

3. **PANW equity upside:** PANW RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW) provide exposure to a ~$130B+ market cap cybersecurity leader. Platform engineers whose work drives customer adoption directly influence the stock price that determines their equity value.

**Level Mapping:** Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineer at CyberArk maps to E4–E6 in the Palo Alto Networks engineering ladder, depending on experience. This is a high-impact IC role that spans mid-senior to staff-level scope within the Identity Security platform team. The most senior hires may receive Principal-level (E7) consideration for platform architecture ownership.

### CyberArk Palo Alto Integration & Identity-First Connectivity Lever

This lever is the single most important negotiation tool for this role. On **Feb 11, 2026**, **Palo Alto Networks** completed its acquisition of CyberArk at a **$25B** valuation — the largest identity security acquisition in history. The acquisition was driven by a single strategic thesis: **Identity-First Connectivity** is the future of enterprise security, and CyberArk's technology is the best foundation for building it.

**What Identity-First Connectivity means technically:**
- Unified identity fabric spanning privileged access, workforce identity, machine identity, and cloud entitlements
- Real-time identity signals flowing into PANW's Cortex XDR, Prisma Access, and Strata firewall products
- Zero-trust access decisions informed by CyberArk's identity risk scoring
- Secrets management integrated natively into PANW's cloud security posture management
- Session monitoring and credential vaulting available as platform services to all PANW customers

**What it means for negotiation:**
The Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineer is the person who builds all of the above. Without this role, the $25B investment in CyberArk fails to generate platform-level returns for **PANW** (NASDAQ: PANW). Your equity is granted as **PANW RSUs**, meaning you are financially aligned with the success of the integration you are building. This is a rare case where the negotiation leverage, the technical work, and the equity upside are all perfectly aligned.

**Advanced negotiation tactics for this lever:**

1. **Quantify the integration value:** "PANW paid $25B for CyberArk's identity capabilities. The Identity-First Connectivity platform is how that $25B translates into incremental PANW revenue. My engineering work directly determines the velocity of that value realization. I'd expect my compensation to reflect this direct financial link."

2. **Reference the acquisition timeline:** "The acquisition closed on Feb 11, 2026, and PANW leadership has stated that platform integration milestones are expected within 12–18 months. The identity fabric I'm building is on the critical path for those milestones. Time-critical, high-stakes engineering commands a premium."

3. **Highlight irreplaceable domain expertise:** "Building the Identity-First Connectivity platform requires deep understanding of privileged access management protocols, identity governance frameworks, and secrets management APIs — combined with platform-scale distributed systems skills. This combination of domain depth and systems breadth is exceptionally rare, and my compensation should reflect that scarcity."

4. **Leverage the PANW equity structure:** "As a PANW RSU holder, my financial upside is tied to the combined company's success. I'd like an RSU grant that reflects the outsized impact of the Identity-First Connectivity platform on PANW's growth trajectory. This isn't a standard product team — it's the platform team that justifies a $25B acquisition."

#### Platform Engineering Scope & Technical Depth

Identity-Connectivity Platform Engineers work across the following technical domains, each of which provides specific negotiation leverage:

**Privileged Access Management (PAM) Platform Layer**
- Credential vaulting APIs and multi-tenant secrets storage
- Session recording, monitoring, and anomaly detection infrastructure
- Just-in-time access provisioning and privilege elevation workflows
- *Negotiation angle:* PAM is CyberArk's flagship capability and the primary driver of the $25B valuation. Engineers who build the PAM platform layer are directly protecting the most valuable technical asset in the acquisition.

**Identity Governance & Administration (IGA) Platform Layer**
- Access certification and recertification workflow engines
- Identity lifecycle management (joiner/mover/leaver) automation
- Role mining, entitlement analytics, and segregation-of-duties policy enforcement
- *Negotiation angle:* IGA is the fastest-growing segment of the identity market. Building CyberArk's IGA capabilities into the PANW platform drives new revenue streams.

**Secrets Management Platform Layer**
- Application-to-application credential injection and rotation
- Dynamic secrets generation for cloud workloads (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Kubernetes and container secrets management integration
- *Negotiation angle:* Secrets management is the bridge between identity security and DevOps/cloud — two of PANW's largest customer segments. Platform engineers building this bridge are creating entirely new market opportunities.

**Identity Fabric & Cross-Platform Connectivity**
- Identity event bus connecting CyberArk identity signals to Cortex XDR
- Zero-trust policy engine integration with Prisma Access
- Identity risk score API consumed by Strata firewalls and SASE products
- *Negotiation angle:* This is the true "connectivity" in Identity-First Connectivity — the technical work that makes the $25B acquisition worth it. Engineers building the identity fabric own the highest-leverage code in the combined organization.

#### Global Levers

**1. Acquisition Thesis Dependency Lever**
> "The $25B acquisition of CyberArk by Palo Alto Networks, completed on Feb 11, 2026, is predicated on successful Identity-First Connectivity platform integration. I'm the engineer building that platform. Without successful platform engineering, PANW's acquisition thesis fails to deliver value. I'd expect compensation that reflects this direct dependency — a package that includes a strong base, substantial PANW RSUs, and a retention grant that ensures I'm committed through the critical integration period."

**2. Identity Platform Scarcity Lever**
> "Engineers who combine deep identity security domain expertise — PAM, IGA, secrets management — with platform-scale distributed systems engineering are extraordinarily rare. I've seen estimates of fewer than 500 engineers globally with this combination. My experience in [specific identity platform technologies] puts me in this exclusive talent pool, and I'd expect compensation at the top of the PANW E5–E6 band to reflect this scarcity."

**3. Multi-Offer Competition Lever**
> "I'm currently evaluating offers from [CrowdStrike Identity Protection / Okta / HashiCorp / SailPoint / Palo Alto Networks direct] with total compensation ranging from $380K to $520K. CyberArk's Identity-First Connectivity platform is the most technically ambitious and strategically important identity engineering opportunity in the market, but the package needs to be competitive at the top of that range. I'm primarily looking for PANW RSU acceleration to close the gap."

**4. Retention & Integration Premium Lever**
> "Post-acquisition platform engineering roles carry inherent retention risk — the integration is complex, the organizational dynamics are evolving, and competing companies are aggressively recruiting CyberArk engineers. I'd like to discuss a supplemental retention RSU grant of $100K (PANW RSUs, 2-year cliff) on top of the standard 4-year vesting grant. This is standard practice for platform-critical hires in post-acquisition environments and demonstrates mutual long-term commitment to the Identity-First Connectivity vision."

#### Advanced PANW RSU Negotiation Tactics

Because all equity for this role is granted as Palo Alto Networks RSUs (NASDAQ: PANW), candidates should employ specific RSU negotiation strategies:

**1. Vesting Schedule Optimization**
- Standard PANW vesting: 25% per year over 4 years, quarterly vesting after Year 1 cliff
- Negotiation tactic: Request front-loaded vesting (e.g., 40/30/20/10) to capture more value early, especially if you believe PANW stock will appreciate as Identity-First Connectivity drives revenue

**2. RSU Grant vs. Stock Price Anchoring**
- RSU grants are denominated in dollar value, not share count, at the time of offer
- If PANW stock has recently dipped, request that the grant be calculated at a 30-day trailing average rather than spot price to lock in more shares
- If PANW stock is at all-time highs, negotiate for a higher dollar value grant to protect against potential pullback

**3. Refresh Grant Commitment**
- Request a written commitment to annual RSU refresh grants, with a minimum refresh amount tied to your performance rating
- Target language: "Annual RSU refresh of at least $50K/yr at 'meets expectations' performance, scaling to $100K+/yr at 'exceeds expectations'"

**4. Retention Grant Stacking**
- In addition to the standard 4-year RSU grant, negotiate a supplemental retention grant that vests over 2 years with a 1-year cliff
- This provides additional equity during the critical integration period while protecting against post-acquisition flight risk

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is the highest-leverage negotiation in the CyberArk portfolio. Open at $205K base + $170K/yr PANW RSUs ($680K over 4 years) + $45K signing bonus + $100K retention RSU grant (PANW RSUs, 2-year vest) for Newton MA. If the initial offer is $170K base with $100K/yr RSUs and no retention grant, counter assertively: cite the acquisition thesis dependency ("my platform work directly determines whether the $25B investment pays off"), reference PANW E5-E6 Levels.fyi data (median $420K–$530K TC), and present your competing CrowdStrike Identity Protection offer at $480K TC. Push for $190K base + $150K/yr PANW RSUs + $100K retention RSUs + $35K signing bonus. Your accept-at floor should be $185K base + $130K/yr PANW RSUs ($520K over 4 years) + $50K retention RSUs + $25K signing bonus, yielding ~$375K total Year 1 comp (excluding retention vest). In Tel Aviv, target ₪630K base + ₪540K/yr PANW RSUs + ₪300K retention RSUs. In London, target £118K base + £115K/yr PANW RSUs + £68K retention RSUs. Never accept below $340K Year 1 total comp for any region, adjusted for local purchasing power parity.

#### Identity-First Connectivity Platform: Strategic Context for Negotiation

Understanding the full strategic context strengthens your negotiation position:

**Why PANW paid $25B for CyberArk:**
- CyberArk is the undisputed leader in privileged access management, with 8,000+ enterprise customers
- Identity-based attacks account for 80%+ of enterprise breaches, making identity security the highest-growth segment in cybersecurity
- PANW's platformization strategy requires native identity capabilities that could not be built organically in a competitive timeframe
- The $25B valuation (completed Feb 11, 2026) reflects a strategic premium over CyberArk's standalone valuation, indicating PANW believes CyberArk + PANW > CyberArk standalone

**Why Identity-First Connectivity is platform-critical:**
- Zero-trust architecture requires real-time identity context for every access decision
- Cloud security posture management (Prisma Cloud) needs CyberArk's secrets management and cloud entitlement capabilities
- XDR (Cortex) needs identity signals to correlate endpoint and network threats with identity-based attacks
- SASE (Prisma Access) needs identity governance to enforce least-privilege access policies at the network edge

**What this means for your compensation:**
You are not joining a small acquired company. You are joining the team that builds the identity platform for a $130B+ market cap cybersecurity leader. Your PANW RSUs give you equity in the parent company, and your engineering work directly drives the platform capabilities that justify PANW's growth premium in the public markets. Negotiate accordingly.
