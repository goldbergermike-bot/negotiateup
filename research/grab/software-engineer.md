**Negotiation DNA**

Grab is the dominant super-app in Southeast Asia, offering ride-hailing, food delivery, digital payments, and financial services to over 40 million monthly transacting users. Software Engineers at Grab work on the rider/driver apps, merchant platform (GrabFood, GrabMart), payments infrastructure (GrabPay), financial services (lending, insurance), and advertising platform. The company is headquartered in Singapore, with engineering teams in Jakarta, Bangalore, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, and a smaller US presence.

Grab's Singapore compensation is competitive within the local tech market, though typically 15-25% below FAANG Singapore offices. RSU grants are in GRAB stock (NASDAQ-listed), providing international equity liquidity. The company has improved compensation packages since its 2021 IPO as it competes with Shopee, ByteDance (TikTok Singapore), and Google for Singapore-based engineering talent.

**Level Mapping:** Software Engineer at Grab (L4-L6) = L3-L4 at Google, IC3-IC4 at Meta, SDE I-II at Amazon

**The Multi-Service Platform Premium**

Grab's super-app architecture requires engineers to understand and build across multiple service domains: real-time dispatch (rides/delivery), payments processing, merchant management, and financial services. This breadth creates versatile engineers who are highly valued in the market.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tech Company Offer:** "I have an offer from [Shopee/Google Singapore/ByteDance] at SGD [X] TC. Grab's super-app breadth is compelling."
2. **Multi-Market Expertise:** "My experience with [multi-region/localization/cross-border] platforms applies to Grab's 8-country operations."
3. **Fintech Skills:** "My payments/fintech experience directly enables Grab's highest-growth vertical."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A SGD [20K-35K] sign-on offsets my current unvested equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's super-app platform is SE Asia's most complex engineering challenge. I have a competing offer from [Shopee/Google] at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+30K] and a SGD 20K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
