**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Grab protect a platform that processes billions in financial transactions, holds digital banking licenses in multiple countries, and manages sensitive personal data for 40M+ users. GrabPay, GrabFin (lending, insurance, investments), and Grab's digital banking operations require bank-grade security and compliance with regulators across eight SE Asian jurisdictions. Grab also processes sensitive location data from ride-hailing operations, adding privacy engineering complexity.

**The Digital Banking Security Premium**

Grab's digital banking licenses (MAS in Singapore, OJK in Indonesia, BNM in Malaysia) require security standards equivalent to traditional banks. Security engineers who can implement and maintain bank-grade security within a tech company are rare and valuable.
