**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Grab (L6-L7) lead the development of critical platform systems across the super-app ecosystem. In Singapore, seniors architect the real-time dispatch system (matching riders with drivers across millions of daily trips), build GrabPay's payment processing infrastructure, develop GrabFin's lending and insurance platforms, and scale merchant tools for hundreds of thousands of GrabFood/GrabMart merchants. Compensation at the senior level has become increasingly competitive as Grab battles Shopee, Google, and ByteDance for Singapore's limited senior engineering talent pool.

**Level Mapping:** Senior SWE at Grab (L6-L7) = L5 at Google, IC5 at Meta, SDE III at Amazon, Senior at Uber/DoorDash

**The Super-App Senior Premium**

Senior engineers at Grab gain unique cross-domain expertise spanning ride-hailing, food delivery, payments, and fintech. This versatility, combined with multi-market experience, makes Grab seniors highly recruited by both regional and global tech companies.
