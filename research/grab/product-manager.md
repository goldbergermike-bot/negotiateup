**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Grab own product lines that directly impact the daily lives of millions of Southeast Asians. PM scope ranges from ride-hailing marketplace optimization to GrabFood merchant experience, GrabPay wallet features, GrabFin lending products, and advertising solutions. PMs must navigate multi-market product-market fit -- what works in Singapore may not work in Indonesia or Vietnam. This cross-country PM experience is rare and highly valued.

**Level Mapping:** PM at Grab (L6-L7) = L5-L6 PM at Google, IC5-IC6 PM at Meta, Sr PM at Amazon

**The Multi-Market PM Premium**

Grab PMs gain experience launching and optimizing products across eight countries simultaneously. This multi-market PM expertise is transferable to any global tech company expanding into emerging markets.

**Global Levers**

1. **FAANG/Shopee PM Offer:** "I have a PM offer from [Google/Meta/Shopee] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Multi-Market Expertise:** "My experience launching products across SE Asian markets directly applies."
3. **Fintech PM Skills:** "My fintech product experience accelerates GrabFin's growth -- Grab's highest-margin vertical."
4. **Marketplace Optimization:** "My marketplace PM experience optimizes Grab's core rides and food businesses."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's multi-country PM scope is extraordinary. I have a competing PM offer from [Google/Shopee] at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+35K] and a SGD 25K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
