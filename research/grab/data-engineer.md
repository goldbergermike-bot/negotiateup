**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Grab build pipelines processing data from rides, food delivery, payments, and financial services across eight SE Asian countries. The data diversity is exceptional: GPS traces, transaction records, merchant analytics, driver behavior, and financial data -- all feeding into dispatch optimization, fraud detection, and business intelligence. Real-time data pipelines are critical for dispatch matching (connecting riders with drivers/food with delivery partners in seconds).

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Grab (L4-L6) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, DE II-Senior at Amazon

**The Real-Time Dispatch Data Premium**

Grab's dispatch system requires real-time data processing to match supply (drivers/delivery partners) with demand (riders/orders) across millions of daily transactions. Data engineers who can build low-latency pipelines for dispatch optimization are highly valued.

**Global Levers**

1. **Data Platform Offer:** "I have an offer from [Snowflake/Databricks/Shopee] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Real-Time Pipeline Expertise:** "My streaming data experience directly improves dispatch matching."
3. **Fintech Data:** "My financial data pipeline experience enables Grab's lending and banking products."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A SGD [20K-30K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's multi-service data challenges are compelling. I have a competing offer at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+25K] and a SGD 20K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
