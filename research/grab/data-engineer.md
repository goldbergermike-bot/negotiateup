**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Grab build pipelines processing data from rides, food delivery, payments, and financial services across eight SE Asian countries. The data diversity is exceptional: GPS traces, transaction records, merchant analytics, driver behavior, and financial data -- all feeding into dispatch optimization, fraud detection, and business intelligence. Real-time data pipelines are critical for dispatch matching (connecting riders with drivers/food with delivery partners in seconds).

**Level Mapping:** Data Engineer at Grab (L4-L6) = L3-L5 at Google, IC3-IC5 at Meta, DE II-Senior at Amazon

**The Real-Time Dispatch Data Premium**

Grab's dispatch system requires real-time data processing to match supply (drivers/delivery partners) with demand (riders/orders) across millions of daily transactions. Data engineers who can build low-latency pipelines for dispatch optimization are highly valued.
