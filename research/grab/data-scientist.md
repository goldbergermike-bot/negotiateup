**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Grab analyze marketplace dynamics across rides, food delivery, payments, and fintech in eight countries. The role encompasses pricing optimization (dynamic pricing for rides, surge algorithms), demand forecasting (predicting order volumes for GrabFood), fraud detection (payment fraud, driver fraud), credit risk modeling (GrabFin lending), and experimentation (A/B testing across culturally diverse markets). The cross-service data -- seeing how a user's ride behavior correlates with their food ordering and payment patterns -- creates analytical opportunities unique to super-apps.

**The Multi-Market Marketplace Premium**

Grab's marketplace analytics must account for eight different countries with different economic conditions, consumer behaviors, and competitive dynamics. Data scientists who can build models that generalize across these markets develop expertise that is highly transferable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tech DS Offer:** "I have a DS offer from [Uber/Meta/Shopee] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Pricing Optimization:** "My dynamic pricing expertise directly impacts Grab's ride and delivery revenue."
3. **Credit Risk Modeling:** "My financial analytics experience enables Grab's lending products."
4. **Experimentation Expertise:** "My A/B testing and causal inference skills optimize Grab's core metrics."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's cross-service marketplace analytics are unique. I have a competing DS offer from [Uber/Shopee] at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+30K] and a SGD 20K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
