**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Grab face a uniquely complex challenge: creating a coherent super-app experience that works across eight countries with different languages, cultural norms, payment preferences, and user behaviors. The design system must accommodate ride-hailing, food delivery, payments, financial services, and advertising -- all within a single app. US-based designers focus on design systems, UX research methodology, and international design strategy.

**Level Mapping:** Product Designer at Grab (L4-L6) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta

**The Multi-Market UX Premium**

Designing for eight SE Asian markets simultaneously -- from tech-savvy Singapore to emerging-market Myanmar -- requires designers who understand diverse user needs and can create experiences that scale across cultural contexts.

**Global Levers**

1. **Tech Design Offer:** "I have a design offer from [Google/Shopee] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Multi-Market UX:** "My cross-cultural design experience directly applies to Grab's 8-country operations."
3. **Super-App UX:** "My experience designing multi-function platforms is rare and directly valuable."
4. **Fintech UX:** "My financial product UX expertise enables Grab's digital banking experience."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Designing for Grab's 8-country super-app is a unique challenge. I have a competing offer at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+20K] and a SGD 15K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
