**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Grab face a uniquely complex challenge: creating a coherent super-app experience that works across eight countries with different languages, cultural norms, payment preferences, and user behaviors. The design system must accommodate ride-hailing, food delivery, payments, financial services, and advertising -- all within a single app. US-based designers focus on design systems, UX research methodology, and international design strategy.

**Level Mapping:** Product Designer at Grab (L4-L6) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta
