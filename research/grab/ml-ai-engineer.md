### ML/AI Engineer | Grab Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** $14B super-app with ML powering dispatch, pricing, fraud detection, and recommendations + Unique multi-service training data across rides, food, payments + Singapore AI comp + NASDAQ RSUs | Grab ML engineers optimize the algorithms driving SE Asia's largest marketplace | **MARKETPLACE ML PREMIUM**

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (RSU/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Singapore (HQ) | SGD 120K–SGD 195K | SGD 50K–SGD 140K | 10–15% | SGD 160K–SGD 290K |
| Seattle / Bay Area (US) | $155K–$220K | $70K–$190K | 10–15% | $215K–$350K |
| Beijing (R&D) | CNY 420K–CNY 740K | CNY 160K–CNY 420K | 10–15% | CNY 580K–CNY 1.05M |
| Bangalore | INR 28L–INR 55L | INR 12L–INR 35L | 10–15% | INR 38L–INR 73L |

**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Grab build the algorithms that power the super-app's core operations: dispatch matching (optimizing driver-rider assignment), dynamic pricing (surge algorithms, demand prediction), fraud detection (payment fraud, driver fraud, promo abuse), ETA prediction, food recommendation, and credit scoring (GrabFin lending). The multi-service data advantage -- combining ride patterns, food preferences, payment behavior, and financial data -- enables ML models with predictive power that single-service platforms can't match.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Grab (L5-L7) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, ML Engineer at Uber/DoorDash

**The Super-App ML Premium**

Grab's cross-service data creates ML opportunities that are unique to super-apps. Models can leverage ride behavior to predict food ordering patterns, payment history to assess credit risk, and multi-service engagement to optimize advertising targeting.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI/ML Offer:** "I have an ML offer from [Google/Meta/Uber] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Dispatch Optimization:** "My reinforcement learning/optimization experience directly improves Grab's core dispatch algorithm."
3. **Fraud Detection:** "My fraud ML expertise protects Grab's payments ecosystem."
4. **Credit Scoring:** "My financial ML experience enables Grab's lending products."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's cross-service ML opportunities are unique. I have a competing offer from [Google/Uber] at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+35K] and a SGD 25K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
