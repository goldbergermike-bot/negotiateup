**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Grab build the algorithms that power the super-app's core operations: dispatch matching (optimizing driver-rider assignment), dynamic pricing (surge algorithms, demand prediction), fraud detection (payment fraud, driver fraud, promo abuse), ETA prediction, food recommendation, and credit scoring (GrabFin lending). The multi-service data advantage -- combining ride patterns, food preferences, payment behavior, and financial data -- enables ML models with predictive power that single-service platforms can't match.

**Level Mapping:** ML/AI Engineer at Grab (L5-L7) = L4-L5 at Google, IC4-IC5 at Meta, ML Engineer at Uber/DoorDash

**The Super-App ML Premium**

Grab's cross-service data creates ML opportunities that are unique to super-apps. Models can leverage ride behavior to predict food ordering patterns, payment history to assess credit risk, and multi-service engagement to optimize advertising targeting.

**Global Levers**

1. **AI/ML Offer:** "I have an ML offer from [Google/Meta/Uber] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Dispatch Optimization:** "My reinforcement learning/optimization experience directly improves Grab's core dispatch algorithm."
3. **Fraud Detection:** "My fraud ML expertise protects Grab's payments ecosystem."
4. **Credit Scoring:** "My financial ML experience enables Grab's lending products."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's cross-service ML opportunities are unique. I have a competing offer from [Google/Uber] at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+35K] and a SGD 25K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
