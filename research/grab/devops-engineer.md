**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Grab manage infrastructure that Southeast Asian consumers depend on daily -- for transportation, food delivery, and financial transactions. The platform must maintain extreme reliability across eight countries with varying infrastructure quality (from Singapore's world-class connectivity to rural Indonesia's challenging network conditions). Grab's multi-region AWS deployment, containerized microservices architecture, and real-time dispatch system create complex infrastructure challenges.

**Level Mapping:** DevOps Engineer at Grab (L4-L6) = L3-L5 SRE at Google, IC3-IC5 PE at Meta, SysDE at Amazon

**The Multi-Country Reliability Premium**

Operating across eight SE Asian countries with different network conditions, regulations, and infrastructure requires DevOps engineers who can build resilient systems that degrade gracefully. This multi-region expertise is highly valuable.

**Global Levers**

1. **Cloud/SRE Offer:** "I have an SRE offer from [Google/Amazon Singapore] at SGD [X] TC."
2. **Multi-Region Expertise:** "My multi-region infrastructure experience directly improves Grab's cross-country reliability."
3. **Real-Time Systems:** "My low-latency infrastructure experience ensures Grab's dispatch system performance."
4. **Sign-On Bridge:** "A SGD [20K-30K] sign-on offsets transition costs."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Thank you for the offer of SGD [X]K base, SGD [Y]K RSUs, and [Z]% bonus. Grab's multi-country infrastructure challenges are unique. I have a competing offer at SGD [W]K TC. To accept, I need RSUs at SGD [Y+25K] and a SGD 20K sign-on, bringing TC to SGD [target]."
