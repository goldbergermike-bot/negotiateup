Key programs include new country launches (regulatory approval, localization, operations setup), digital banking rollouts (MAS, OJK compliance), cross-service feature integration (linking rides, food, and payments into unified experiences), and infrastructure modernization. TPMs must navigate multi-country regulatory environments, cultural differences, and complex stakeholder landscapes.
