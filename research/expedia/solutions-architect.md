Solutions Architects at Expedia Group design and implement technical solutions that span the company's multi-brand travel ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — processing over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. SAs at Expedia work at the intersection of business requirements and technical architecture, designing systems that must serve partner integrations, internal platforms, and traveler-facing applications across all five brands. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates solutions architects with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages anchored to the Seattle HQ and Austin tech markets.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Solutions Architect at Expedia Group, my architectural designs don't serve just one brand — I design solutions that integrate with and power all five Expedia brands simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards across brands into a single system, my compensation should reflect my unified architectural impact across the entire portfolio. I'm designing systems that must handle $100B+ in gross bookings across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my architectural work, not siloed to a single brand's technology budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I create through cross-brand solution design: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand architectural impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My solution designs power integrations and systems across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand architectural impact."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My architectural decisions directly shape how partner integrations and internal systems handle $100B+ in annual gross bookings across all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I design solutions that must work coherently across five consumer travel brands, handling unique brand requirements while leveraging shared platform capabilities."
4. **Partner & Integration Complexity:** "Solutions architects at Expedia manage architectural relationships with thousands of hotel, airline, and activity partners across all five brands. This multi-brand integration complexity demands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $182K base and $148K RSUs over 4 years for this Solutions Architect position with unified cross-brand comp. My architectural designs will power integrations across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand architectural impact. I have competing offers from Amazon at $265K TC / Booking.com at $248K TC." Accept at $170K+ base and $130K+ RSUs.
