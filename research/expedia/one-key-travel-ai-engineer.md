**Negotiation DNA**

The One Key Travel AI Engineer is Expedia Group's signature technical role — the engineer who builds the AI that makes the One Key unified loyalty experience intelligent across all five brands: Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. This role sits at the intersection of Expedia's most strategic initiatives: One Key personalization AI that learns traveler preferences across brands, cross-brand recommendation engines that surface the right hotel/flight/vacation rental regardless of which brand a traveler uses, travel intent understanding systems that decode what travelers actually want, dynamic pricing optimization that maximizes value for travelers and revenue for Expedia across $100B+ in annual gross bookings, and unified loyalty AI that determines how One Key Cash rewards are earned, valued, and redeemed across the entire ecosystem. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates this signature AI role with a 20-30% premium over standard software engineering bands, with substantial RSU packages on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, reflecting the role's critical importance to Expedia's unified platform strategy.

**Level Mapping:** Expedia One Key Travel AI Engineer = Google Senior ML Engineer L5/L6 = Booking.com Senior ML Engineer = Airbnb Senior ML Engineer = Amazon Applied Scientist III = Microsoft Senior ML Engineer 64/65 (Note: This is a signature role with no direct equivalent — the cross-brand unified loyalty AI specialization is unique to Expedia Group)

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "I am the One Key AI Engineer — the engineer who builds the intelligence that makes the One Key unified loyalty program work across all five Expedia Group brands. This isn't a metaphor for me; this IS my job. I build the AI systems that power One Key personalization across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My cross-brand recommendation engines determine which hotels, flights, and vacation rentals travelers see regardless of which brand they're using. My travel intent understanding models decode what travelers want and my dynamic pricing optimization maximizes value across $100B+ in gross bookings. My unified loyalty AI determines how One Key Cash is earned, valued, and redeemed across the entire ecosystem. My compensation must be unified like One Key — because I literally build the AI that unifies One Key. (1) Just as One Key unified rewards across brands, my comp should reflect my unified impact — I don't work for one brand, I build the AI that makes ALL of Expedia's brands intelligent simultaneously. (2) My engineering work impacts Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously — my comp should be unified like One Key, reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my AI work, not siloed to a single brand's budget. (3) I should push for equity grants that reflect the total $100B+ gross bookings across all brands that my AI optimizes, not just one brand's revenue. (4) One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand AI impact at the highest premium level."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "I literally build the AI that powers One Key across all five brands. There is no more unified cross-brand impact than the One Key Travel AI Engineer role. My comp must be the most unified of any role at Expedia Group — reflecting the full cross-brand multiplier of the AI that makes One Key intelligent."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My personalization AI, recommendation engines, and dynamic pricing optimization directly shape how $100B+ in annual gross bookings flow through the entire Expedia ecosystem. A 0.1% improvement in my models drives $100M+ in incremental value across all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I build AI systems that simultaneously personalize the experience across five major consumer travel brands. My cross-brand recommendation engine must understand traveler preferences across hotels (Expedia, Hotels.com), vacation rentals (Vrbo), and travel packages (Orbitz, Travelocity) — a uniquely complex multi-brand AI challenge."
4. **Signature Role AI Premium (+20-30%):** "The One Key Travel AI Engineer is Expedia Group's signature AI role, commanding a 20-30% premium over standard engineering compensation. This premium reflects the role's strategic importance, the scarcity of engineers who can build cross-brand loyalty AI, and the competitive AI talent market in Seattle where Expedia competes with Google, Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI for AI talent."
5. **One Key Personalization & Dynamic Pricing AI:** "My AI systems power the core One Key experience: personalized recommendations across all brands, travel intent understanding that decodes what travelers want, and dynamic pricing optimization that maximizes value for both travelers and Expedia. These systems directly drive the success of Expedia's most strategic initiative."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $250K base and $265K RSUs over 4 years for this One Key Travel AI Engineer signature role with unified cross-brand comp and maximum AI premium. I am building the AI that makes One Key work — the personalization engine, cross-brand recommendations, travel intent understanding, and dynamic pricing that powers $100B+ in bookings across all five brands. There is no more unified cross-brand impact than this role. I have competing offers from Google at $380K TC / OpenAI at $400K TC / Airbnb at $365K TC." Accept at $235K+ base and $240K+ RSUs.
