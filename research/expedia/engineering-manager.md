**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Expedia Group lead teams that build and maintain the technology platform powering a multi-brand travel ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — processing over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. EMs at Expedia own both people leadership and technical delivery, managing teams whose output directly impacts traveler experience and revenue across all five brands simultaneously. Expedia Group (EXPE) provides RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and the management track offers competitive packages anchored to the Seattle HQ market with a strong secondary presence in Austin.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As an Engineering Manager, I lead teams whose output doesn't stop at brand boundaries — my team builds systems that power Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards so travelers earn across all brands, my compensation should reflect my unified team leadership and cross-brand delivery impact. I'm managing engineers who build for $100B+ in gross bookings across all five brands. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my team's output, not constrained by a single brand's headcount budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I help create by leading cross-brand engineering teams: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand impact as a people leader."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My team's engineering output powers the shared platform across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand team impact, not be budgeted against a single brand."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "I lead teams whose code handles transactions across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The reliability and scale requirements for my team's deliverables span all five brands simultaneously."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "Managing engineering teams that build for five consumer travel brands simultaneously requires cross-brand coordination and prioritization skills beyond single-product management."
4. **People Leadership & Retention Impact:** "Engineering managers at Expedia directly impact retention and productivity of scarce engineering talent in the competitive Seattle/Austin tech markets. My leadership has a multiplier effect on the organization's output."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $245K base and $260K RSUs over 4 years for this Engineering Manager position with unified cross-brand comp. My team will deliver across all five Expedia Group brands, and just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand team impact. I have competing offers from Amazon at $380K TC / Microsoft at $360K TC." Accept at $225K+ base and $230K+ RSUs.
