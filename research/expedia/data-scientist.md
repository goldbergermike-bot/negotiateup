**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Expedia Group work with one of the richest travel datasets in the world, analyzing traveler behavior, booking patterns, pricing dynamics, and loyalty engagement across a multi-brand ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — that processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The One Key unified loyalty program has created an unprecedented cross-brand dataset, allowing data scientists to analyze traveler behavior across all five brands holistically. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates data scientists with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages anchored to the Seattle HQ market.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Data Scientist at Expedia Group, my analyses and models don't serve just one brand — they leverage the unified One Key dataset to generate insights across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards so traveler data flows across all brands, my compensation should reflect my unified analytical impact. I'm modeling behavior and driving decisions across $100B+ in gross bookings. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my data science work, not siloed to a single brand's analytics budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I help unlock through cross-brand data insights: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand data impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My data science work leverages the unified One Key dataset across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand analytical impact."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My models and analyses directly optimize revenue and conversion across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. Data-driven decisions at this scale have massive financial impact across all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I build models that analyze traveler behavior across five consumer brands simultaneously, leveraging the unified One Key dataset. This cross-brand analytical complexity is unique to Expedia's multi-brand platform."
4. **Cross-Brand Data Richness Premium:** "Expedia Group's unified One Key data creates one of the richest travel datasets in the world. My ability to extract cross-brand insights from this unique dataset commands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $185K base and $155K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Scientist position with unified cross-brand comp. My analyses will leverage the unified One Key dataset across all five brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand analytical impact. I have competing offers from Airbnb at $275K TC / Booking.com at $255K TC." Accept at $172K+ base and $138K+ RSUs.
