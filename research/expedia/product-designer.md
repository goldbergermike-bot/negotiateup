**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Expedia Group craft the end-to-end traveler experience across a multi-brand ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — that serves hundreds of millions of travelers and processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. Designers at Expedia face a unique challenge: creating cohesive user experiences that leverage the unified One Key loyalty system while maintaining distinct brand identities for each of the five consumer brands. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates designers with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages benchmarked to the competitive Seattle design market and Austin secondary hub.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Product Designer at Expedia Group, my design work shapes how travelers interact with ALL five brands — not just one. Just as One Key unified the rewards experience so travelers move seamlessly across brands, my design systems and interaction patterns power the unified experience across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My compensation should reflect this unified design impact. I'm crafting experiences that touch $100B+ in gross bookings. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my design work, not siloed to a single brand's design budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect total enterprise value across all brands: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand design impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My design work creates shared patterns and unified experiences across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand design impact."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "Every design decision I make impacts conversion rates across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. A single interaction pattern improvement can drive millions in incremental revenue across all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I design systems that must be coherent across five consumer travel brands while preserving brand identity. This multi-brand design system complexity is rare and demands premium compensation."
4. **Design System & Brand Coherence:** "Building unified design systems that maintain brand differentiation while ensuring cross-brand usability is an exceptionally complex design challenge unique to multi-brand platform companies like Expedia Group."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $158K base and $125K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Designer position with unified cross-brand comp. My design work will shape the traveler experience across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand design impact. I have competing offers from Airbnb at $225K TC / Booking.com at $210K TC." Accept at $148K+ base and $110K+ RSUs.
