**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Expedia Group coordinate complex, cross-functional technical programs across a multi-brand travel ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — that processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. TPMs at Expedia are uniquely positioned at the intersection of engineering, product, and business, driving execution of programs that span multiple brands, teams, and geographies simultaneously. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates TPMs with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages benchmarked to the competitive Seattle program management market and Austin secondary hub.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Technical Program Manager at Expedia Group, my programs don't stop at brand boundaries — I coordinate technical initiatives that span Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards across all brands, my compensation should reflect my unified program leadership across the entire portfolio. I'm driving execution of programs that affect $100B+ in gross bookings across all five brands. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my program management work, not siloed to a single brand's program budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I enable through cross-brand program coordination: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand program impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My technical programs span Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand program leadership, not be constrained by one brand's program budget."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My program execution directly impacts delivery velocity and quality across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. Program delays or miscoordination at this scale have massive financial consequences."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I coordinate technical programs that must deliver coherently across five consumer travel brands. The cross-brand coordination complexity at Expedia Group exceeds what's required at single-product companies."
4. **Cross-Functional & Cross-Brand Coordination:** "TPMs at Expedia uniquely coordinate across engineering, product, design, and business teams spanning five brands and multiple geographies. This cross-functional, cross-brand coordination scope demands premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $175K base and $140K RSUs over 4 years for this Technical Program Manager position with unified cross-brand comp. My programs will coordinate delivery across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand program impact. I have competing offers from Amazon at $255K TC / Google at $245K TC." Accept at $162K+ base and $122K+ RSUs.
