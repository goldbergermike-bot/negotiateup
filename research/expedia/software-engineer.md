**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Expedia Group build the foundational systems that power one of the world's largest online travel platforms, spanning five major consumer brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — and processing over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The company's unified technology stack means even junior engineers write code that touches millions of travelers across all brands simultaneously, creating outsized impact compared to single-product companies. Expedia Group (EXPE) grants RSUs on a standard 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff, and its Seattle headquarters anchors compensation to the competitive Pacific Northwest tech market while its growing Austin office offers strong secondary-market packages.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Software Engineer at Expedia Group, every line of code I write doesn't just serve one brand — it powers the shared platform behind Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards across brands so travelers earn and redeem seamlessly, my compensation should reflect my unified impact across the entire portfolio. I'm not building for a single brand's P&L — I'm engineering systems that handle $100B+ in gross bookings across five major travel brands. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my work, not siloed to a single brand's budget. I should receive EXPE RSUs that reflect the total enterprise value I help create across all brands, because One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My engineering work powers the shared platform across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand multiplier, not be budgeted against a single brand."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "Every feature I build processes transactions across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The scale and reliability requirements at Expedia Group rival any top-tier tech company, and my compensation should reflect that."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I'm building systems that simultaneously serve five major consumer travel brands. That's 5x the impact surface of a single-product company, and my comp should reflect the architectural complexity of multi-brand platform engineering."
4. **Seattle Tech Market Competition:** "Expedia's Seattle HQ puts it in direct competition with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta for engineering talent. My offer should be competitive with these peers, especially given the cross-brand scale of Expedia's platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $155K base and $130K RSUs over 4 years for this Software Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp. My work will power all five Expedia Group brands simultaneously — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my compensation should reflect unified cross-brand impact rather than single-brand budgeting. I have competing offers from Amazon at $185K TC / Booking.com at $178K TC." Accept at $150K+ base and $110K+ RSUs.
