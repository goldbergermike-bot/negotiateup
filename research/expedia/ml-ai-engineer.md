**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Expedia Group build the machine learning models and AI systems that power personalization, search ranking, dynamic pricing, recommendation engines, and fraud detection across a multi-brand travel ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — processing over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The One Key unified loyalty program has created a rich cross-brand dataset enabling ML models to learn from traveler behavior across all five brands simultaneously, creating uniquely powerful training signals. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates ML/AI engineers with a 15-25% AI premium over standard software engineering bands, with RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, anchored to the premium Seattle AI/ML talent market.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As an ML/AI Engineer at Expedia Group, my models don't serve just one brand — they power personalization, search ranking, and recommendations across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards across brands, my ML models leverage the unified cross-brand dataset to deliver AI-powered experiences everywhere. My compensation should reflect this unified AI impact. I'm building models that optimize $100B+ in gross bookings across all five brands, with training signals enriched by the cross-brand One Key data. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my AI work plus the AI talent premium, not siloed to a single brand's ML budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I create through cross-brand AI: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand AI impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My ML models power personalization and ranking across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand AI impact plus the AI talent premium."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My models directly optimize conversion, pricing, and personalization across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. A 0.1% improvement in my models drives tens of millions in incremental revenue across all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I build ML systems that serve five consumer travel brands simultaneously, leveraging the unified One Key dataset for cross-brand training signals. This cross-brand ML complexity is unique and commands premium compensation."
4. **AI Talent Market Premium (+15-25%):** "ML/AI engineers command a 15-25% premium over standard software engineering compensation. In the Seattle market, Expedia competes with Google, Amazon, Meta, and AI startups for this scarce talent."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $225K base and $215K RSUs over 4 years for this ML/AI Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp and AI talent premium. My models will power personalization and ranking across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my AI models leverage unified cross-brand data to drive $100B+ in bookings. I have competing offers from Google at $345K TC / Meta at $335K TC." Accept at $210K+ base and $190K+ RSUs.
