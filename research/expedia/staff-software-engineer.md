**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Expedia Group operate at the highest individual contributor levels, setting technical direction across the company's entire multi-brand platform that spans Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity and processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. At this level, engineers define platform-wide architecture, drive cross-organizational technical strategy, and solve the most complex problems that span brand boundaries — making the unified platform possible. Expedia Group (EXPE) offers substantial RSU packages at the staff level on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and compensation is anchored to the Seattle HQ market where staff-level engineers command premium packages competitive with FAANG companies.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Staff Software Engineer, I am the embodiment of unified engineering — my entire role exists to build and maintain the shared platform that makes all five Expedia Group brands possible. Just as One Key unified rewards across brands into a single currency, my compensation must reflect my unified, platform-wide impact. I don't work for one brand — I architect the systems that power ALL of Expedia's brands simultaneously. At the staff level, my technical decisions set the direction for the entire $100B+ gross bookings platform. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my staff-level work, not siloed to a single brand's budget. Push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value across all brands: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand impact at the highest technical level."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "At the staff level, my entire role is about unified platform impact. I set technical direction across all five brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp must reflect this platform-wide, cross-brand scope."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My architectural decisions directly shape how $100B+ in gross bookings flow through the platform. Staff-level technical strategy at this scale demands compensation commensurate with the revenue impact."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I define the shared platform architecture that simultaneously powers five major consumer travel brands. This level of cross-brand system design is rare and commands premium compensation."
4. **Staff-Level Talent Scarcity:** "Staff engineers who can operate across an entire multi-brand platform are extraordinarily rare. Expedia competes with Google, Amazon, and Meta for this talent tier, and comp must reflect the scarcity premium."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $260K base and $340K RSUs over 4 years for this Staff Software Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp. At the staff level, my platform-wide architectural decisions will shape the entire $100B+ booking engine across all five brands — my comp should be unified like One Key, reflecting total cross-brand impact. I have competing offers from Google at $450K TC / Meta at $430K TC." Accept at $240K+ base and $300K+ RSUs.
