**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Expedia Group build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence across a multi-brand travel ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — processing over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The One Key unified loyalty program has dramatically increased data pipeline complexity, as traveler identity, rewards, and booking data must now flow seamlessly across all five brands through unified data infrastructure. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates data engineers with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages anchored to the competitive Seattle data engineering market.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Data Engineer at Expedia Group, my data pipelines and infrastructure don't serve just one brand — I build the unified data layer that connects Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity into a coherent data ecosystem. Just as One Key unified rewards across brands, I unified the data infrastructure that makes cross-brand analytics and ML possible. My compensation should reflect this unified data impact. I'm engineering pipelines that process booking, traveler, and loyalty data across $100B+ in gross bookings. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my data engineering work, not siloed to a single brand's data budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I enable through cross-brand data infrastructure: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand data infrastructure impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My data pipelines power the unified data layer across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand data infrastructure impact."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My data pipelines process transaction, booking, and loyalty data across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. Data infrastructure reliability at this scale is mission-critical for all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I build data infrastructure that must integrate data from five consumer travel brands into a unified, cross-brand data platform. This cross-brand data engineering complexity is unique to multi-brand platform companies."
4. **One Key Data Unification Complexity:** "The One Key loyalty program requires unified data pipelines that merge traveler identity, rewards, and booking data across five previously separate brand data systems. This unification work is extraordinarily complex and high-value."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $178K base and $142K RSUs over 4 years for this Data Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp. My data infrastructure will power the unified data layer across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand data infrastructure impact. I have competing offers from Amazon at $258K TC / Airbnb at $245K TC." Accept at $165K+ base and $125K+ RSUs.
