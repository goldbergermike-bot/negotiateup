**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Expedia Group manage the infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and platform reliability for one of the world's largest online travel platforms, supporting a multi-brand ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — that processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The unified platform architecture means DevOps engineers must ensure availability, deployment velocity, and infrastructure efficiency across all five brands simultaneously, with zero-downtime requirements during peak travel seasons. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates DevOps engineers with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, benchmarked to the competitive Seattle infrastructure engineering market.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a DevOps Engineer at Expedia Group, my infrastructure work doesn't serve just one brand — I build and maintain the deployment pipelines, monitoring systems, and infrastructure that power Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. Just as One Key unified rewards across all brands, my compensation should reflect my unified infrastructure impact. When I improve deployment velocity or reduce downtime, it benefits all five brands and $100B+ in gross bookings. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my infrastructure work, not siloed to a single brand's ops budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I protect through cross-brand infrastructure reliability: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand infrastructure impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My infrastructure and DevOps work powers the shared platform across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand infrastructure impact."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "Every infrastructure decision I make affects the reliability and performance of $100B+ in annual gross bookings. Platform downtime across all five brands has outsized financial impact."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I manage infrastructure that simultaneously serves five major consumer travel brands. The deployment complexity, monitoring scope, and reliability requirements span the entire Expedia Group ecosystem."
4. **Zero-Downtime & Peak Season Reliability:** "Travel infrastructure must handle massive seasonal spikes across all five brands simultaneously. My DevOps work ensures platform reliability during peak booking periods when every minute of downtime costs millions."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $178K base and $142K RSUs over 4 years for this DevOps Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp. My infrastructure work will ensure reliability across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand infrastructure impact. I have competing offers from Amazon at $258K TC / Booking.com at $240K TC." Accept at $165K+ base and $125K+ RSUs.
