**Negotiation DNA**

Senior Software Engineers at Expedia Group own critical systems and lead technical initiatives across the company's multi-brand travel platform, which processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. At the senior level, engineers are expected to drive architectural decisions that span brands, mentor junior engineers, and deliver projects that directly impact traveler experience and revenue across the entire portfolio. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates senior engineers with a meaningful RSU component on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and the Seattle HQ ensures comp benchmarks against top-tier Pacific Northwest employers while the Austin office provides a strong secondary hub.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Senior Software Engineer, I lead technical initiatives that don't stop at brand boundaries — my architectural decisions, code reviews, and system designs power the shared infrastructure behind all five Expedia Group brands. Just as One Key unified rewards so a traveler's loyalty isn't siloed to one brand, my compensation should reflect my unified technical leadership across the entire portfolio. I'm designing systems that handle $100B+ in gross bookings across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my senior-level impact, not constrained by a single brand's engineering budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value across all brands, because One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My senior engineering work shapes the shared platform architecture across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand leadership, not be siloed to one brand's budget."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "At the senior level, my technical decisions directly impact system reliability and performance across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. The blast radius of my architectural choices spans all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I architect systems that simultaneously serve five major consumer travel brands. This cross-brand complexity demands senior-level system thinking that exceeds what's required at single-product companies."
4. **Technical Leadership & Mentorship Premium:** "Senior engineers at Expedia multiply impact through mentorship and technical leadership across brand-spanning teams. My influence extends beyond individual contribution to raising engineering quality across the platform."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $210K base and $180K RSUs over 4 years for this Senior Software Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp. My architectural decisions will span all five Expedia Group brands, and just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my compensation should reflect unified cross-brand impact. I have competing offers from Google at $330K TC / Amazon at $305K TC." Accept at $195K+ base and $160K+ RSUs.
