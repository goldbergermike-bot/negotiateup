**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Expedia Group define the traveler experience across one of the world's largest online travel platforms, shaping product strategy for a multi-brand ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — that processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings. PMs at Expedia uniquely must balance cross-brand product coherence with brand-specific differentiation, making product decisions that affect hundreds of millions of travelers globally. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates PMs with a mix of base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages anchored to the Seattle HQ market and competitive Austin secondary hub.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Product Manager at Expedia Group, my product decisions shape the traveler experience across all five brands — not just one. Just as One Key unified rewards so travelers earn and redeem across the entire portfolio, my compensation should reflect my unified product impact. I'm defining product strategy that affects $100B+ in gross bookings across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity simultaneously. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my product work, not siloed to a single brand's product budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise value I drive through cross-brand product strategy: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand product impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My product decisions shape the traveler experience across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand product impact, not be constrained by one brand's product budget."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "My product roadmap directly influences conversion and revenue across $100B+ in annual gross bookings. Product decisions at this scale have outsized impact compared to single-product companies."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I define product requirements that must work coherently across five consumer travel brands while maintaining brand differentiation. This cross-brand product complexity is unique to multi-brand platform companies."
4. **Traveler Experience & Revenue Impact:** "PMs at Expedia directly impact the booking funnel for hundreds of millions of travelers. Every product decision I make has a measurable revenue impact across the entire brand portfolio."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $200K base and $165K RSUs over 4 years for this Product Manager position with unified cross-brand comp. My product decisions will shape the traveler experience across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, my comp should reflect unified cross-brand product impact. I have competing offers from Airbnb at $305K TC / Google at $290K TC." Accept at $185K+ base and $145K+ RSUs.
