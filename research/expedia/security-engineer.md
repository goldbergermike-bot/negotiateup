**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Expedia Group protect one of the world's largest online travel platforms, safeguarding traveler data, payment systems, and identity infrastructure across a multi-brand ecosystem — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — that processes over $100B+ in annual gross bookings and handles sensitive PII and payment data for hundreds of millions of travelers. The unified One Key loyalty system creates additional security surface area, as a single identity and rewards currency now spans all five brands. Expedia Group (EXPE) compensates security engineers with base salary, RSUs on a standard 4-year vest with 1-year cliff, and performance bonus, with packages reflecting the critical nature of security in travel and the competitive Seattle security engineering market.

**One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Equity**

Expedia's One Key program unified rewards across all travel brands — Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — into a single loyalty currency (One Key Cash). Use this as a metaphor for negotiating unified comp: "As a Security Engineer at Expedia Group, my security work protects ALL five brands simultaneously — not just one. Just as One Key unified rewards across brands, creating a single identity surface that I must protect, my compensation should reflect my unified security impact across the entire portfolio. A single vulnerability could expose traveler data across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity — and compromise $100B+ in gross bookings. My comp should be unified like One Key — reflecting the cross-brand multiplier of my security work, not siloed to a single brand's security budget. I should push for equity grants that reflect the total enterprise risk I mitigate across all brands: One Key Cash works across all brands — my compensation should too. I want EXPE RSUs that reflect my unified cross-brand security impact."

**Global Levers**

1. **One Key Unified Comp — Cross-Brand Impact:** "My security engineering work protects the unified identity, payment, and data systems across Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, and Travelocity. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand security impact."
2. **$100B+ Gross Bookings — Multi-Brand Scale:** "I protect payment and identity systems processing $100B+ in annual gross bookings. A security breach at this scale would have catastrophic financial and reputational consequences across all five brands."
3. **Multi-Brand Platform Engineering:** "I secure infrastructure that simultaneously protects five consumer travel brands. The cross-brand attack surface and compliance requirements at Expedia Group exceed most single-product companies."
4. **Regulatory & Compliance Complexity:** "Security engineers at Expedia navigate PCI-DSS, GDPR, CCPA, and travel-specific regulations across five brands and multiple jurisdictions. This multi-brand compliance complexity demands specialized expertise and premium compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $195K base and $168K RSUs over 4 years for this Security Engineer position with unified cross-brand comp. My security work will protect traveler data and payment systems across all five Expedia Group brands — just as One Key unified the loyalty experience, a security breach would be unified across all brands too. My comp should reflect this unified cross-brand risk. I have competing offers from Amazon at $290K TC / Google at $278K TC." Accept at $182K+ base and $150K+ RSUs.
