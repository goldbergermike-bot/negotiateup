**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at MoneyGram protect an infrastructure that processes billions of dollars in cross-border transactions for 200M+ customers -- and that infrastructure now spans both traditional payment rails and the Stellar/USDC Crypto-Bridge platform. The Dec 2025 Genius Act has introduced new security and compliance requirements for stablecoin service providers, creating an entirely new security domain that MoneyGram must address. Security engineers who can protect both fiat payment systems and blockchain-native infrastructure are among the scarcest talent in the entire technology industry.

MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries multiplies the security surface area: each new corridor introduces new threat vectors, regulatory requirements, and integration points that must be secured. The MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) product presents unique security challenges -- wallet key management, smart contract security, and the bridge between custodial and non-custodial assets. As a private company under Madison Dearborn Partners, MoneyGram's option grants carry pre-liquidity upside, and a single security breach could destroy the enterprise value that the Genius Act has unlocked. Security engineers don't just protect the platform -- they protect the equity value.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Dual-Domain Security Scarcity:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act mandates security controls for stablecoin operations that are distinct from traditional payment security requirements. MoneyGram needs security engineers who can implement and audit controls across both domains -- traditional PCI-DSS payment security and blockchain-native smart contract/wallet security. This dual-domain expertise is extraordinarily rare. I'm asking for a base salary of $195,000-$215,000, which is consistent with what security engineers at crypto custodians and regulated blockchain companies earn."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Crypto Corridor Threat Surface:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries has dramatically expanded the threat surface, with each corridor introducing new attack vectors, regulatory security requirements, and integration vulnerabilities. I'd like a 15% security complexity premium on my bonus target, with a performance multiplier tied to security posture metrics across the LatAm Crypto-Bridge corridors -- zero breaches, audit pass rates, and vulnerability remediation timelines."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Custody Security:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp involves the custody and movement of digital assets, which creates security responsibilities that are existential for the company. A key management failure or wallet compromise would be catastrophic. As the security engineer responsible for Ramp security architecture, I'd like an option grant at the 80th percentile -- $70,000-$85,000 annually -- reflecting the asymmetric impact of security on MoneyGram's post-Genius Act enterprise value."

**Lever 4 -- Regulatory Security Audit Readiness:** "The Genius Act requires ongoing security audits and compliance certifications for stablecoin service providers. I'll be responsible for ensuring MoneyGram passes these audits, which directly impacts the company's ability to operate. I'd like a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus recognizing the immediate security audit value I bring, plus a quarterly audit readiness bonus of $3,000-$5,000 for maintaining Crypto-Bridge compliance certification."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $260,000-$320,000 (Dallas) or $300,000-$370,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $195,000 (Dallas) or $220,000 (New York), anchoring to the dual-domain security scarcity and citing security roles at Coinbase, Fireblocks, and Circle as comparables. Push for option grants of at least $60,000/yr, framing security as the prerequisite for MoneyGram's Genius Act-enabled growth. Your accept-at floor is $220,000 total comp (Dallas) or $260,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus, a security tools and training budget ($10,000-$15,000/yr), and a 6-month review tied to Crypto-Bridge security milestones. Security engineers should also negotiate for SANS/OSCP/blockchain security certification reimbursement, bug bounty program participation bonuses, and incident response on-call compensation.
