**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at MoneyGram operate at the intersection of two massive data ecosystems: the transaction data from 200M+ traditional remittance customers and the emerging on-chain data from the company's Stellar/USDC Crypto-Bridge infrastructure. The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created regulatory clarity for stablecoin-enabled financial services, which means MoneyGram can now build data products and models that incorporate blockchain transaction data into compliance, fraud detection, and customer segmentation workflows. This dual-data-domain expertise -- traditional payment analytics combined with on-chain analytics -- is exceptionally scarce in the market.

MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries has generated novel datasets around cross-border crypto corridor usage patterns, and the MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) product creates entirely new data science challenges around user behavior modeling, risk scoring, and conversion optimization. As a private company under Madison Dearborn Partners, MoneyGram offers option grants that carry meaningful pre-liquidity upside, especially now that the Genius Act has validated the company's Crypto-Bridge strategy. Data scientists who can extract insights from both fiat and crypto transaction data are central to MoneyGram's valuation story.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Dual-Domain Data Scarcity:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created demand for data scientists who can work across both traditional financial data and blockchain/on-chain data -- and MoneyGram is one of the very few companies that has both at scale. I have experience in [traditional analytics / on-chain analytics], and the intersection of these two domains commands a significant premium. I'm asking for a base salary of $180,000-$200,000, reflecting the scarcity of data scientists who can model both fiat remittance patterns and Stellar/USDC transaction flows."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Crypto Corridor Analytics Ownership:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries has created novel datasets that no other company in the world has. The data science work on these corridors -- fraud modeling, corridor optimization, customer segmentation, regulatory reporting -- is greenfield and high-impact. I'd like my bonus target to include a 1.5x performance multiplier tied to LatAm Crypto-Bridge corridor analytics milestones, recognizing that my models will directly influence corridor profitability."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Conversion Science:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp product generates high-value behavioral data that, when modeled correctly, can significantly improve conversion rates and lifetime value. As a data scientist focused on Ramp analytics, my work has a direct and measurable revenue impact. I'd like an option grant at the top of the range -- $65,000-$75,000 annually -- reflecting the enterprise value that conversion optimization on Ramp will create in the post-Genius Act growth environment."

**Lever 4 -- Compliance Analytics Regulatory Premium:** "The Genius Act creates new regulatory reporting requirements for stablecoin transactions, and MoneyGram needs data scientists who can build the analytics infrastructure for regulatory compliance. This is not optional work -- it's legally mandated. I'd like a $15,000-$20,000 sign-on bonus recognizing the immediate compliance analytics value I bring, plus a written commitment to a 6-month review with a 10% base adjustment trigger tied to compliance analytics deliverables."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $230,000-$290,000 (Dallas) or $270,000-$340,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $180,000 (Dallas) or $205,000 (New York), anchoring to the dual-domain data scarcity premium and citing comparable roles at Chainalysis, Stripe, and Coinbase. Push for option grants of at least $50,000/yr, emphasizing the Genius Act pre-repricing opportunity. Your accept-at floor is $200,000 total comp (Dallas) or $240,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $15,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus, access to premium data tools and cloud compute budget, and a 6-month review tied to Crypto-Bridge analytics milestones. Data scientists should also negotiate for conference presentation opportunities, publication rights for non-proprietary research, and access to MoneyGram's full transaction data warehouse.
