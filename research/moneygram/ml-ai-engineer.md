**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at MoneyGram are building the intelligence layer that powers fraud detection, transaction routing, risk scoring, and customer experience optimization across both traditional remittance channels and the Stellar/USDC Crypto-Bridge platform. The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created new compliance and surveillance requirements for stablecoin service providers that are best addressed through machine learning -- real-time transaction monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated regulatory reporting at a scale that serves 200M+ customers. ML/AI talent is the most competitive hiring market in technology, and MoneyGram's unique data advantage -- the combination of massive traditional remittance datasets with emerging on-chain blockchain data -- makes this role particularly compelling.

MoneyGram's expansion of Stellar/USDC across 6+ LatAm countries generates novel datasets for ML model training: cross-border transaction patterns, corridor-specific fraud signatures, currency conversion behavior, and Crypto-Bridge usage adoption curves. The MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) product creates new ML challenges around conversion optimization, risk tiering, and personalized user experiences. As a private company under Madison Dearborn Partners, MoneyGram's option grants carry pre-liquidity upside, and ML/AI engineers who can extract value from the intersection of traditional financial data and blockchain data are central to the company's post-Genius Act valuation trajectory.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Dual-Data ML Scarcity:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created demand for ML engineers who can build models across both traditional financial transaction data and on-chain blockchain data. MoneyGram is one of the very few companies that has both data domains at scale -- 200M+ customer transaction histories combined with Stellar/USDC on-chain data. ML engineers who can build models spanning these two data paradigms are exceptionally rare. I'm asking for a base salary of $205,000-$230,000, reflecting the ML talent market premium compounded by the dual-data-domain specialization."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Corridor ML Optimization:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries creates unique ML optimization opportunities -- corridor-specific fraud models, dynamic pricing algorithms, and transaction routing optimization that can save millions in settlement costs. I'd like my bonus target to include a performance multiplier tied to ML model impact metrics across LatAm Crypto-Bridge corridors, with a 1.5x-2x bonus kicker for models that demonstrably improve corridor economics."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Intelligence Layer:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp product needs a sophisticated ML intelligence layer for risk scoring, fraud detection, and conversion optimization. As the ML engineer building this intelligence layer, my models will directly determine Ramp's loss rates, conversion rates, and ultimately profitability. I'd like an option grant at the top of the range -- $85,000-$100,000 annually -- reflecting the direct revenue and risk impact of ML models on MoneyGram's highest-growth product."

**Lever 4 -- Compliance ML Automation Premium:** "The Genius Act mandates transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting for stablecoin service providers. ML-powered compliance automation is the only scalable way to meet these requirements across MoneyGram's global transaction volume. I'd like a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus recognizing the immediate compliance ML value I bring, plus a dedicated GPU compute budget ($15,000-$25,000/yr) and a 6-month review with a 12% base adjustment trigger tied to compliance model deployment milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $270,000-$345,000 (Dallas) or $320,000-$400,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $205,000 (Dallas) or $235,000 (New York), anchoring to the dual-data ML scarcity premium and citing ML roles at Stripe, Plaid, Chainalysis, and top-tier fintech companies as comparables. Push for option grants of at least $70,000/yr, framing it as a Genius Act pre-repricing opportunity in a company where ML directly drives enterprise value. Your accept-at floor is $235,000 total comp (Dallas) or $280,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $20,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus, a dedicated GPU/cloud ML compute budget, and a 6-month review tied to Crypto-Bridge ML model deployment milestones. ML/AI engineers should also negotiate for conference attendance (NeurIPS, ICML), publication rights, open-source contribution time, and access to MoneyGram's full transaction data warehouse for model training.
