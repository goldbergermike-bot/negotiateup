**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at MoneyGram are defining the product strategy for a company that is simultaneously serving 200M+ customers through traditional remittance channels while building the world's most ambitious Crypto-Bridge platform. The Dec 2025 Genius Act -- the first comprehensive U.S. stablecoin regulatory framework -- has unlocked product opportunities that didn't exist even six months ago, and PMs are the ones translating regulatory clarity into product roadmaps. MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC integration across 6+ LatAm countries has proven the product-market fit; now the PM role is about scaling that model globally through the MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) and adjacent products.

Since Madison Dearborn Partners took MoneyGram private in 2023, the product organization has been empowered to move with startup-like speed while leveraging the scale of a company with a global agent network and deep regulatory relationships. As a PM, you are the connective tissue between MoneyGram's Crypto-Bridge engineering teams and the 200M+ customers who need seamless cross-border money movement. Your negotiation leverage comes from the rarity of PMs who understand both the regulatory intricacies of cross-border payments and the product dynamics of blockchain-native financial products. The private equity structure means your option grants carry genuine upside, and the Genius Act has made that upside considerably more tangible.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Regulatory-Product Translation Premium:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created a new product landscape for stablecoin-enabled financial services, and MoneyGram needs PMs who can translate regulatory frameworks into product specifications. This is an extremely rare skill set -- the intersection of regulatory literacy, cross-border payments domain knowledge, and crypto-native product thinking. My base salary should reflect this triple-threat scarcity. I'm targeting $190,000-$210,000 base to match what PMs with comparable regulatory-product expertise earn at companies like Circle, Stripe, and Wise."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Crypto Corridor Product Ownership:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries has created entirely new product corridors that need dedicated PM leadership. I'll be defining the product strategy for how millions of consumers in these markets interact with the Crypto-Bridge platform. This is greenfield product work at massive scale. I'd like my bonus target increased from the standard 15% to 20-25%, with a performance multiplier tied to LatAm corridor product adoption metrics."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Product-Market Fit Premium:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp is arguably the company's most strategically important product initiative. As the PM for Ramp or adjacent products, I'm directly responsible for product-market fit on a platform that could define MoneyGram's next decade. I'd like an option grant at the top of the stated range -- $80,000-$85,000 annually -- reflecting the enterprise value my product decisions will create, especially in the post-Genius Act regulatory environment."

**Lever 4 -- Private Company Product Leadership Equity:** "At a private company like MoneyGram, the PM's product decisions directly influence the valuation at any future liquidity event. I'd like to negotiate a provision where my option grant is refreshed annually based on product milestone achievement -- specifically, if the products I own hit revenue or adoption targets, I receive an additional option grant of $20,000-$30,000. This creates direct alignment between my product strategy and my compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $260,000-$320,000 (Dallas) or $300,000-$370,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $190,000 (Dallas) or $215,000 (New York), anchoring to the regulatory-product translation premium and citing PM roles at Circle, Stripe, and Wise as comparables. Push for option grants of at least $60,000/yr, framing it as a Genius Act pre-repricing investment. Your accept-at floor is $220,000 total comp (Dallas) or $260,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $20,000-$35,000 sign-on bonus framed as a "Crypto-Bridge product strategy onboarding accelerator," plus a guaranteed 6-month review with a written 10-15% base adjustment trigger tied to product milestone delivery. PMs should also negotiate for direct access to customer research budget, user testing tools, and quarterly executive product review presentations.
