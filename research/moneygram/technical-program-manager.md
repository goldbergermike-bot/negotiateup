**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at MoneyGram orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives in the company's history: the simultaneous operation of legacy remittance systems serving 200M+ customers and the buildout of a Crypto-Bridge platform powered by Stellar/USDC across 6+ LatAm countries. The Dec 2025 Genius Act has imposed new regulatory milestones and compliance timelines that make program management not just operationally important but legally mandated. TPMs at MoneyGram are managing programs where delays don't just cost revenue -- they can result in regulatory non-compliance in the new stablecoin framework.

Since Madison Dearborn Partners took MoneyGram private in 2023, the pace of the digital-first transformation has intensified, and TPMs are the ones ensuring that dozens of engineering, product, compliance, and operations workstreams converge on schedule. The MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) product launch across new markets is a flagship program management challenge: coordinating blockchain engineering, banking partner integrations, regulatory approvals, and consumer rollout across multiple countries simultaneously. Your negotiation leverage comes from the scarcity of TPMs who can manage programs that span both traditional financial services and blockchain infrastructure -- a skill set that the Genius Act has made urgently valuable.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Regulatory Program Delivery Premium:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created hard regulatory deadlines for stablecoin compliance that MoneyGram must hit. As a TPM, I'll be the person responsible for ensuring that engineering, legal, and compliance teams deliver against these non-negotiable milestones. Program managers who can drive regulatory-grade delivery in blockchain-adjacent environments are rare and valuable. I'm asking for a base salary of $195,000-$215,000, reflecting the premium for TPMs who can manage Genius Act compliance programs."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Multi-Country Launch Coordination:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries requires coordinating launches across multiple regulatory jurisdictions, banking systems, and agent networks simultaneously. Each country launch is essentially a separate program with shared dependencies. I'd like a 15% premium on my bonus target to reflect the multi-country coordination complexity, with a bonus multiplier tied to successful LatAm Crypto-Bridge corridor launches."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Program Ownership:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp product launch is a flagship program that touches every function in the company. As the TPM driving Ramp delivery, I'm the single point of accountability for the company's most strategically important initiative. I'd like my option grant sized at the top of the range -- $70,000-$80,000 annually -- reflecting the direct link between Ramp program delivery and MoneyGram's post-Genius Act enterprise value."

**Lever 4 -- Cross-Functional Crypto-Bridge Complexity:** "Managing a program that spans traditional payment processing, blockchain engineering, regulatory compliance, and consumer product development requires a TPM who can translate between fundamentally different technical cultures. This cross-functional Crypto-Bridge complexity is unlike anything at a traditional fintech company. I'd like a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus recognizing the immediate cross-functional coordination value I bring, plus a written commitment to a 6-month review with a 10-12% base adjustment trigger."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $260,000-$320,000 (Dallas) or $300,000-$370,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $195,000 (Dallas) or $220,000 (New York), anchoring to the regulatory program delivery premium and citing TPM roles at Stripe, Square, and Coinbase as comparables. Push for option grants of at least $55,000/yr, framing it as a Genius Act pre-repricing opportunity. Your accept-at floor is $220,000 total comp (Dallas) or $260,000 total comp (New York). If the company resists on base, negotiate a $20,000-$30,000 sign-on bonus, a dedicated program management tooling budget, and a 6-month review tied to Crypto-Bridge program milestones. TPMs should also negotiate for executive stakeholder access, quarterly board program updates (for visibility), and a clear path to Director of Program Management.
