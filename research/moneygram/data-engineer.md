**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at MoneyGram are building the data infrastructure that unifies two fundamentally different data paradigms: high-volume traditional remittance transaction data from 200M+ customers and real-time on-chain data from the Stellar/USDC Crypto-Bridge platform. The Dec 2025 Genius Act has imposed new data governance, reporting, and audit trail requirements for stablecoin service providers, and data engineers are the ones building the pipelines that make compliance possible at scale. Without robust data engineering, MoneyGram cannot satisfy regulators, optimize corridors, or scale the MoneyGram Ramp product.

MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries generates data across multiple blockchain networks, banking APIs, agent systems, and mobile applications -- all of which must be ingested, normalized, and made available for analytics, compliance, and real-time decision-making. The digital-first transformation under Madison Dearborn Partners has required a complete overhaul of MoneyGram's data architecture, from legacy batch ETL to streaming pipelines that support both fiat and crypto transaction processing. As a private company, MoneyGram's option grants offer genuine pre-liquidity upside, and the Genius Act regulatory clarity has made a future liquidity event significantly more probable.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- On-Chain/Off-Chain Data Unification:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act requires MoneyGram to maintain comprehensive audit trails that span both traditional fiat transactions and Stellar/USDC on-chain transactions. Building data pipelines that unify these two data domains -- with different schemas, latencies, and governance models -- is a specialized skill that very few data engineers possess. I'm asking for a base salary of $180,000-$200,000, benchmarked against data engineering roles at companies that bridge traditional finance and blockchain data, like Chainalysis, Plaid, and Circle."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Corridor Data Pipeline Complexity:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC corridors across 6+ LatAm countries each generate data from different banking partners, regulatory systems, and agent networks. Building data pipelines that normalize and reconcile data across these heterogeneous sources is materially more complex than single-market data engineering. I'd like a 12-15% complexity premium on my base salary, or alternatively, a dedicated cloud compute and data infrastructure budget that I can direct toward LatAm Crypto-Bridge pipeline optimization."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Data Platform Equity:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp product depends on real-time data pipelines for transaction processing, fraud detection, and compliance reporting. As the data engineer building the Ramp data platform, my infrastructure will directly determine the product's scalability and reliability. I'd like an option grant at the 75th percentile -- $60,000-$75,000 annually -- reflecting the foundational role that data infrastructure plays in MoneyGram's post-Genius Act growth."

**Lever 4 -- Compliance Data Architecture Premium:** "The Genius Act creates new data retention, reporting, and audit requirements that MoneyGram must implement as a stablecoin service provider. Building the compliance data architecture isn't optional -- it's legally required. I'd like a $15,000-$22,000 sign-on bonus recognizing the immediate compliance data value I bring, plus a guaranteed 6-month review with a 10% base adjustment trigger tied to compliance data pipeline delivery milestones."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $230,000-$290,000 (Dallas) or $270,000-$340,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $180,000 (Dallas) or $205,000 (New York), anchoring to the on-chain/off-chain data unification premium. Push for option grants of at least $50,000/yr, framing it as a Genius Act pre-repricing opportunity. Your accept-at floor is $200,000 total comp (Dallas) or $240,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $15,000-$22,000 sign-on bonus, a cloud compute budget allocation ($5,000-$10,000/yr for pipeline development), and a 6-month review tied to Crypto-Bridge data pipeline milestones. Data engineers should also negotiate for data engineering certification reimbursement (Databricks, Snowflake, Spark), conference attendance, and access to MoneyGram's full historical transaction data for pipeline development.
