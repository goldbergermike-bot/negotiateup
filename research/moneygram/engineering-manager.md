**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at MoneyGram are leading teams through the most consequential technical transformation in the company's 80+ year history. The shift from legacy money transfer operations to a digital-first, Crypto-Bridge-enabled platform requires managers who can recruit, retain, and lead engineers across two radically different technical paradigms. Since Madison Dearborn Partners took MoneyGram private in 2023, the pace of this transformation has accelerated dramatically, with the Stellar/USDC stablecoin integration across 6+ LatAm countries serving as both proof of concept and scaling template. The Dec 2025 Genius Act -- the first U.S. stablecoin regulatory framework -- has validated this strategy and created urgency to hire and scale engineering teams faster.

As an Engineering Manager, you are the force multiplier for MoneyGram's entire Crypto-Bridge strategy. You are responsible for building teams that can deliver on the MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) product roadmap while maintaining the reliability of systems serving 200M+ customers. Your negotiation leverage is rooted in the extreme difficulty of finding engineering leaders who understand both traditional payment processing team dynamics and blockchain-native development cultures. The private company equity structure means your option grants carry real asymmetric upside, and the Genius Act has made a future liquidity event significantly more probable.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Talent Acquisition Multiplier:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created a surge in demand for engineers with crypto-fintech experience, and MoneyGram needs to hire aggressively to capitalize on its Crypto-Bridge first-mover advantage. As an Engineering Manager, I'll be competing for talent against Circle, Ripple, Coinbase, and traditional fintech companies -- all of whom are scaling post-Genius Act. My compensation needs to be competitive enough that I can credibly recruit into my team. I'm asking for a base salary of $230,000-$255,000 so I'm not managing engineers who out-earn me."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Team Scaling Premium:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries requires building and managing distributed engineering teams across multiple time zones and regulatory environments. This is a materially more complex management challenge than a single-site team. I'd like a management complexity premium of 10-15% on my bonus target, reflecting the cross-border team leadership that the LatAm Crypto-Bridge expansion demands."

**Lever 3 -- Private Equity Retention Structure:** "As a private company, MoneyGram's ability to retain engineering leadership depends heavily on the option grant structure. I'd like to negotiate a front-loaded vesting schedule -- 40% in Year 1, 30% in Year 2, 20% in Year 3, 10% in Year 4 -- to reflect the urgency of the Genius Act scaling window. The next 18-24 months are when MoneyGram's Crypto-Bridge advantage will either compound or erode, and my compensation should reflect the intensity of this period."

**Lever 4 -- MoneyGram Ramp Team Ownership Equity:** "I understand I'll be leading the team responsible for the MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp platform. This product has the potential to become MoneyGram's highest-growth business line. I'd like an additional option tranche of $25,000-$40,000 annually, specifically tied to Ramp team delivery milestones -- feature velocity, platform uptime, and user acquisition targets. This creates direct alignment between my team's output and my compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $320,000-$400,000 (Dallas) or $370,000-$460,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $230,000 (Dallas) or $260,000 (New York), anchoring to the talent acquisition argument -- you need to be compensated competitively to recruit competitively. Push for option grants of at least $85,000/yr, framing it as Genius Act pre-repricing equity. Your accept-at floor is $280,000 total comp (Dallas) or $330,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $30,000-$50,000 sign-on bonus, a written headcount commitment for your team (ensuring you have the resources to deliver on Crypto-Bridge milestones), and a 6-month compensation review with a 12-15% adjustment trigger tied to team scaling targets. Engineering managers should also negotiate for executive coaching budget, leadership development stipend, and quarterly board visibility on team metrics.
