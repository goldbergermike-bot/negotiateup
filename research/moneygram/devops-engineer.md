**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at MoneyGram are responsible for the infrastructure that keeps money moving for 200M+ customers across traditional remittance channels and the company's rapidly scaling Crypto-Bridge platform. The Dec 2025 Genius Act has accelerated MoneyGram's stablecoin infrastructure buildout, and DevOps engineers are the ones ensuring that the Stellar/USDC integration across 6+ LatAm countries operates with the reliability and compliance standards that both regulators and customers demand. When a remittance transaction settles on-chain via Stellar, there is zero tolerance for infrastructure failure -- and that operational criticality translates directly into negotiation leverage.

MoneyGram's digital-first transformation under Madison Dearborn Partners has required a complete modernization of the company's infrastructure stack, from legacy on-premises systems to cloud-native, containerized architectures that support both fiat and crypto transaction processing. The MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp) product imposes particularly demanding DevOps requirements: real-time blockchain node management, multi-region failover, and compliance-grade audit logging. As a private company, MoneyGram's option grants offer pre-liquidity upside that is now significantly de-risked by the Genius Act regulatory framework.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Blockchain Infrastructure Scarcity:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has triggered a wave of stablecoin infrastructure buildout across the financial services industry, and DevOps engineers who can manage both traditional payment infrastructure and blockchain node operations are in extremely short supply. At MoneyGram, I'll be managing infrastructure for Stellar/USDC transaction processing alongside legacy remittance systems -- this dual-infrastructure competency commands a premium. I'm asking for a base salary of $175,000-$195,000, benchmarked against infrastructure roles at Coinbase, Circle, and similar Crypto-Bridge companies."

**Lever 2 -- LatAm Multi-Region Reliability Premium:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC expansion across 6+ LatAm countries requires multi-region infrastructure with compliance-grade reliability across jurisdictions with varying network conditions, data sovereignty requirements, and regulatory mandates. This is materially more complex than single-region DevOps. I'd like a 10-15% complexity premium on my base or a dedicated infrastructure budget allocation that I can direct toward LatAm Crypto-Bridge reliability improvements."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Uptime Equity:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp requires 99.99% uptime to maintain customer trust and regulatory compliance. As the DevOps engineer responsible for Ramp infrastructure, my work directly protects revenue and reputation. I'd like an option grant at the 75th percentile of the range -- $55,000-$70,000 annually -- with the understanding that Ramp infrastructure reliability is a prerequisite for the post-Genius Act growth thesis that makes MoneyGram's equity story compelling."

**Lever 4 -- On-Call and Incident Response Compensation:** "Given that MoneyGram's Crypto-Bridge infrastructure operates 24/7 across multiple time zones and blockchain networks, the on-call burden is higher than at a typical fintech company. I'd like to negotiate an on-call compensation structure -- either a $1,500-$2,500 monthly on-call stipend or a 5-8% base salary adjustment -- to reflect the operational reality of maintaining Stellar/USDC infrastructure alongside traditional payment systems."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $220,000-$275,000 (Dallas) or $260,000-$325,000 (New York). Open with a base salary ask of $175,000 (Dallas) or $200,000 (New York), anchoring to the blockchain infrastructure scarcity premium. Push for option grants of at least $45,000/yr, framing it as a Genius Act pre-repricing opportunity. Your accept-at floor is $190,000 total comp (Dallas) or $225,000 total comp (New York). If the company pushes back on base, negotiate a $15,000-$25,000 sign-on bonus, a monthly on-call stipend, and a guaranteed 6-month review tied to Crypto-Bridge infrastructure reliability milestones. DevOps engineers should also negotiate for cloud certification reimbursement, home office infrastructure budget (for on-call), and access to blockchain infrastructure training programs.
