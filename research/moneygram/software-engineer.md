**Negotiation DNA**

MoneyGram International is no longer just a legacy remittance company. Since being taken private by Madison Dearborn Partners in 2023, MoneyGram has undergone a radical digital-first transformation, positioning itself as the world's premier Crypto-Bridge pioneer connecting traditional money transfer rails with blockchain-native infrastructure. The Dec 2025 Genius Act -- the first comprehensive U.S. stablecoin regulatory framework -- has validated MoneyGram's early bet on Stellar/USDC integration across 6+ LatAm countries, creating a once-in-a-generation regulatory tailwind that makes every engineering hire strategically critical.

As a Software Engineer at MoneyGram, you are building the core systems that power 200M+ customer transactions across both legacy corridors and the rapidly scaling MoneyGram Ramp (crypto on/off ramp). The company's private status means your option grants carry substantial upside potential in a pre-liquidity environment. With the Genius Act providing regulatory clarity, MoneyGram's valuation trajectory is tied directly to its ability to scale crypto-bridge infrastructure -- and that depends on the engineers writing the code. Your negotiation leverage comes from the scarcity of engineers who can work across both traditional payment rails and blockchain-native protocols.

### Genius Act -- The Crypto-Bridge Pioneer Premium

**Lever 1 -- Regulatory Tailwind Valuation:** "The Dec 2025 Genius Act has created the first clear U.S. regulatory framework for stablecoins, and MoneyGram is arguably the best-positioned company to capitalize on it. My option grant should reflect the fact that I'm joining at the inflection point -- before the market fully prices in MoneyGram's Crypto-Bridge advantage. I'd like to see the option pool increased by 20-30% to account for this pre-repricing window."

**Lever 2 -- Stellar/USDC LatAm Scarcity Premium:** "MoneyGram's Stellar/USDC integration across 6+ LatAm countries is a first-mover advantage that very few engineers have direct experience building. Engineers who can work across both traditional remittance APIs and Stellar blockchain protocols command a premium in the current market. I'm asking for a base salary at the 75th percentile to reflect this hybrid skill scarcity."

**Lever 3 -- MoneyGram Ramp Scale Factor:** "The MoneyGram Ramp crypto on/off ramp product is scaling rapidly, and every software engineer contributing to that platform is directly impacting revenue growth. I'd like my bonus target to include a performance multiplier tied to Ramp transaction volume milestones, with a 15-20% upside on the standard bonus target."

**Lever 4 -- Private Equity Liquidity Timeline:** "As a private company backed by Madison Dearborn Partners, MoneyGram's equity story depends on a liquidity event. I'd like to negotiate an accelerated vesting schedule -- either a one-year cliff with monthly vesting thereafter, or a provision for early exercise of options -- so that I can participate fully in the upside that the Genius Act and Crypto-Bridge positioning are creating."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target a total comp package of $190,000-$230,000 (Dallas) or $220,000-$260,000 (New York). Open your counter at 15-20% above the initial offer on base salary, anchoring to the Genius Act regulatory tailwind and the Crypto-Bridge premium that makes MoneyGram's engineering roles uniquely valuable compared to standard fintech positions. Push for option grants in the top quartile of the stated range, emphasizing that you're joining pre-liquidity event. Your accept-at floor should be $165,000 total comp (Dallas) or $195,000 total comp (New York), with a minimum option grant of $30,000/yr. If the company pushes back on base, pivot to a sign-on bonus of $15,000-$25,000 framed as a "Crypto-Bridge onboarding accelerator" and request a 6-month compensation review tied to MoneyGram Ramp milestones.
