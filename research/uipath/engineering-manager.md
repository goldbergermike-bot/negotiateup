**Negotiation DNA**
Engineering Managers at UiPath lead teams building the world's leading enterprise automation platform. An EM at UiPath typically manages 8-12 engineers and owns delivery for product areas within the automation suite — Studio (automation design), Orchestrator (bot management), AI Center (ML model deployment), Document Understanding (intelligent document processing), or platform infrastructure. The role requires balancing product delivery speed with the quality and reliability that enterprise customers demand from their automation infrastructure.

UiPath compensates EMs competitively, with total comp ranging from $280K-$430K for US roles. The company's $12B market cap and NYC headquarters place it in the upper mid-tier of enterprise software, with packages that approach the lower range of FAANG EM compensation. UiPath has been increasing management compensation as it competes with Microsoft (Power Automate), Google (Cloud Workflows), and other large tech companies for automation engineering talent.

UiPath's engineering organization is globally distributed, with major development centers in Bucharest (Romania), Bangalore (India), Bellevue (WA), and NYC. EMs often manage teams that span time zones and cultures, which adds leadership complexity but also creates career development opportunities. EMs who excel at building productive global teams have outsized impact.

**UiPath AI Automation Leadership Premium**
Engineering Managers leading UiPath's AI initiatives — AI Center, Document Understanding, Communications Mining, or the agentic AI platform — have the strongest negotiating position. These are UiPath's highest-growth product areas, and EMs driving AI delivery are directly tied to the company's competitive differentiation against Microsoft Power Automate and Automation Anywhere.

EMs with experience managing through a platform evolution — shifting from traditional software to AI-powered products — bring directly relevant experience. UiPath is in the midst of this transformation, and needs leaders who can maintain team morale and delivery velocity while the product strategy evolves.

**Global Levers**
1. **AI Team Leadership:** "I've built and led AI/ML engineering teams that delivered [production AI features] at [company]. UiPath's AI automation strategy requires EMs who understand both the technical and organizational dimensions of AI product development."
2. **Global Team Management:** "I've led distributed teams across [X] time zones, which directly maps to UiPath's global engineering organization spanning Bucharest, Bangalore, and US locations."
3. **Platform Transformation Experience:** "I've led engineering through [traditional-to-AI/monolith-to-platform] transitions at [company]. This directly supports UiPath's evolution from RPA to AI-powered automation."
4. **Competing EM Offers:** "I'm evaluating EM roles at [Microsoft/Google/ServiceNow] at $X. UiPath's automation platform challenges are compelling, and I need competitive compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my experience leading [team size] engineers through [AI product transformation/platform evolution], I'm targeting total compensation of $400K. Engineering Managers who can drive UiPath's AI automation delivery while building productive global teams are essential. My floor is $370K in total comp. I'd welcome a heavy RSU weighting and a sign-on bonus of $35K-$50K to offset forfeited equity."
