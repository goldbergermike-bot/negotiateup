**Negotiation DNA**
Data Engineers at UiPath build the data infrastructure that powers both the automation platform's analytics and its AI capabilities. UiPath generates rich process execution data — every automation run produces detailed logs of steps taken, decisions made, exceptions encountered, and outcomes achieved. Data Engineers architect the pipelines that transform this process telemetry into actionable analytics, process mining insights, and training data for AI models. The data is uniquely valuable: it captures how businesses actually operate at a granular level.

UiPath compensates Data Engineers competitively within the enterprise automation tier, with packages that reflect the company's NYC/Bellevue headquarters locations. The company values Data Engineers who can build the data foundation for AI features — every intelligent automation capability depends on high-quality process data, and the Data Engineering team is a critical enabler.

The data engineering challenges at UiPath are distinctive: processing millions of automation execution events in real-time, building process mining data pipelines that reconstruct business workflows from event logs, and creating the data infrastructure for training and evaluating AI models on enterprise process data. Data Engineers who enjoy working at the intersection of process analytics and ML data infrastructure thrive here.

**UiPath Process Data Premium**
Data Engineers who bring experience with process mining data — event log processing, process discovery algorithms, or conformance checking — have specialized leverage. UiPath's process mining capabilities are a key differentiator, and Data Engineers who understand how to transform raw event data into structured process models are directly aligned with the product's intelligence layer.

Engineers with experience building ML training data pipelines — dataset creation, labeling infrastructure, data quality monitoring for ML — bring additional value as UiPath expands its AI capabilities. The quality of AI automation features depends directly on the quality of training data.

**Global Levers**
1. **Process Mining Data Expertise:** "I bring experience with [process mining/event log processing/process analytics] data pipelines. This directly supports UiPath's process intelligence capabilities."
2. **ML Data Infrastructure:** "I've built training data pipelines and feature stores for ML models at [company]. This directly enables UiPath's AI automation features."
3. **Enterprise Telemetry at Scale:** "My experience processing [millions of events/enterprise telemetry] at scale maps to UiPath's automation execution data processing needs."
4. **Competing Data Offers:** "I have data engineering offers from [comparable companies] at $X. UiPath's process data challenges are compelling, and I need competitive compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "With my data engineering experience in [process mining data/ML data infrastructure/enterprise telemetry], I'm targeting total compensation of $265K. Data Engineers who can build pipelines for process intelligence and AI training data are in specialized demand. My floor is $242K in total comp. I'd welcome a stronger RSU component and a sign-on bonus."
