**Negotiation DNA**
Technical Program Managers at UiPath coordinate the delivery of automation platform features across a globally distributed engineering organization. Whether managing a major platform release that spans Studio, Orchestrator, and Robot components; driving the rollout of AI Center capabilities; coordinating Document Understanding model deployments; or orchestrating cross-product integration programs, TPMs at UiPath manage complexity at the intersection of traditional software engineering, AI/ML delivery, and globally distributed teams.

UiPath compensates TPMs competitively within the enterprise automation tier. The company's global engineering footprint — with major centers in Bucharest, Bangalore, Bellevue, and NYC — adds coordination complexity that TPMs must navigate. Programs span time zones, cultures, and development practices, which requires TPMs with strong cross-cultural communication skills and timezone-aware project management.

TPMs at UiPath need genuine technical credibility, as the automation platform involves diverse technologies (.NET, Python, cloud infrastructure, AI/ML) and the engineering teams expect TPMs to understand technical trade-offs. TPMs who can engage in architecture discussions while also managing program-level dependencies and stakeholder communication have outsized impact.

**UiPath Global Delivery Premium**
TPMs who bring experience managing programs across globally distributed engineering teams have particular leverage. UiPath's development model — with significant engineering capacity in Romania, India, and the US — requires TPMs who can maintain program velocity across cultural and timezone differences. If you've managed delivery for programs spanning US, European, and Indian engineering centers, this experience is directly transferable.

TPMs with experience in AI/ML product delivery — managing model development cycles, coordinating data labeling programs, and orchestrating AI feature rollouts — are in growing demand as UiPath accelerates AI capability development.

**Global Levers**
1. **Global Program Management:** "I've managed programs spanning [X] geographies with [Y] teams at [company]. UiPath's global engineering footprint (US, Romania, India) requires exactly this cross-cultural program coordination expertise."
2. **AI Delivery Experience:** "I bring experience managing [AI/ML product delivery/model deployment programs]. UiPath's AI automation strategy requires TPMs who understand AI development cycles."
3. **Platform Release Coordination:** "I've coordinated multi-component platform releases with [X] interdependent deliverables at [company]. UiPath's platform (Studio + Orchestrator + Robot + AI Center) requires exactly this multi-product coordination."
4. **Technical Credibility:** "I combine program management with genuine technical depth in [.NET/Python/cloud]. TPMs who can engage credibly in UiPath's technical discussions are more effective."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my experience managing [global engineering programs/AI delivery/multi-component platforms], I'm targeting total compensation of $292K. TPMs who can coordinate delivery across UiPath's global engineering organization while maintaining quality and velocity are rare. My floor is $268K in total comp. I'd welcome additional RSUs and a sign-on bonus to offset transition costs."
