**Negotiation DNA**
Product Managers at UiPath own the strategy and execution for automation products that enable enterprises to transform their operations. Whether managing Studio (the automation IDE), Orchestrator (bot management), AI Center (ML model deployment), Document Understanding (IDP), or the growing suite of platform capabilities, PMs at UiPath make decisions that affect how thousands of enterprises automate their most repetitive and error-prone processes.

UiPath compensates PMs competitively within the enterprise automation tier. The company's transformation from RPA to AI-powered automation means PMs are making strategic product decisions that will determine UiPath's competitive position for the next decade. PMs who can drive this evolution while maintaining the core RPA product's market leadership are exceptionally valuable.

UiPath's PM culture values deep customer empathy, technical credibility, and strategic thinking. PMs work closely with enterprise automation customers — IT directors, automation COEs (Centers of Excellence), and business process owners — who have specific needs and strong opinions about automation tooling. PMs who can navigate these stakeholder relationships while driving product innovation thrive at UiPath.

**Level Mapping:** UiPath PM (IC3/IC4) ~ Microsoft 63/64 PM | Google L5/L6 PM | Salesforce Senior/Lead PM | Automation Anywhere Senior/Lead PM

**UiPath AI Automation Product Premium**
Product Managers driving UiPath's AI product expansion — AI Center, agentic automation, Document Understanding, or Communications Mining — have the strongest negotiating position. These products represent UiPath's growth strategy and directly determine whether the company can successfully transition from RPA to AI-powered enterprise automation.

PMs with experience in automation, AI products, or developer tools bring directly transferable domain expertise. If you've managed products that serve both technical and non-technical users (developer platforms with citizen developer modes), this dual-audience PM experience is highly relevant to UiPath's product strategy.

**Global Levers**
1. **Automation Domain Expertise:** "I bring direct experience with [automation/RPA/process intelligence] product management. PMs who understand enterprise automation buyer needs are rare and immediately effective."
2. **AI Product Management:** "I've shipped AI-powered products at [company]. UiPath's AI transformation requires PMs who understand AI capabilities and limitations."
3. **Developer Platform Experience:** "My experience managing [developer tools/low-code platforms/IDE products] maps directly to UiPath Studio and the automation builder experience."
4. **Competing PM Offers:** "I have PM offers from [Microsoft/ServiceNow/comparable] at $X. UiPath's automation challenges are unique, and I need competitive compensation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my product management experience in [automation/AI products/developer platforms], I'm targeting total compensation of $300K. PMs who can drive UiPath's transition from RPA to AI-powered automation are essential to the company's competitive strategy. My floor is $275K in total comp. I'd welcome a heavier RSU allocation and a sign-on bonus."
