#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Product Designers at ServiceTitan design for one of the most challenging user contexts in software: field technicians using mobile devices on job sites with variable connectivity, while simultaneously serving office dispatchers managing complex scheduling boards. The dual-persona design challenge — mobile-first for field technicians, desktop-optimized for office staff — requires specialized design expertise.

ServiceTitan's users are often not traditional tech workers. Designing interfaces that are intuitive for HVAC technicians, plumbers, and electricians requires deep empathy and user research with a non-traditional user base.

#### ServiceTitan Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | ServiceTitan Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Product Designer | PD (IC3-IC4) | 2–5 years |
| Senior Product Designer | Senior PD (IC5) | 5–8 years |
| Staff Product Designer | Staff PD (IC6) | 8–12 years |

### ServiceTitan Post-IPO Growth & Home Services Platform Premium

Designers shape the user experience that drives contractor adoption and retention: "I design for field technicians and office staff simultaneously — creating experiences that work on a job site and in the dispatch center. My understanding of home services workflows enables me to design interfaces that contractors actually use."

#### Global Lever 1: Core Platform & Scheduling Engine

Scheduling UX design: "I will design the scheduling and dispatching interface — the most-used screen in the platform. My experience designing real-time operational interfaces translates directly to ServiceTitan's core product."

#### Global Lever 2: Payments & FinTech Integration

Payments experience design: "I will design the payment and financing flows that help contractors get paid faster. Making financial transactions simple on a mobile device at a job site requires specialized design expertise."

#### Global Lever 3: AI & Automation for Home Services

AI interface design: "I will design the AI-powered features — making automation transparent and trustworthy for contractors who may be skeptical of technology."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Platform & Analytics

Analytics dashboard design: "I will design the analytics dashboards that help contractors understand their business performance — translating complex data into actionable insights for non-technical users."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $160,000 base with $100,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $210,000 total comp.
