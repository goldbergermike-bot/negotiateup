#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Product Designers at ServiceTitan design for one of the most challenging user contexts in software: field technicians using mobile devices on job sites with variable connectivity, while simultaneously serving office dispatchers managing complex scheduling boards. The dual-persona design challenge — mobile-first for field technicians, desktop-optimized for office staff — requires specialized design expertise.

ServiceTitan's users are often not traditional tech workers. Designing interfaces that are intuitive for HVAC technicians, plumbers, and electricians requires deep empathy and user research with a non-traditional user base.
