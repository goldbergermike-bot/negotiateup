#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Engineering Managers at a recently-IPO'd company face a unique challenge: scaling the engineering organization to meet public market expectations while maintaining the velocity and culture that drove pre-IPO success. ServiceTitan needs EMs who can recruit aggressively, build high-performing teams, and deliver on ambitious product roadmaps.

The post-IPO period is the most talent-intensive phase of a company's lifecycle. EMs who can attract senior engineers, establish engineering processes, and drive execution at scale are critical to ServiceTitan's public market narrative.
