#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

DevOps at ServiceTitan is mission-critical: the platform is the operating system for contractors' businesses. Downtime means technicians sitting in trucks, dispatchers unable to schedule, and customers unable to book service. The reliability bar is exceptionally high, and DevOps engineers who can maintain this bar while enabling rapid feature delivery are essential.

The post-IPO scaling imperative adds urgency: ServiceTitan must grow infrastructure efficiently while maintaining reliability metrics that the public market evaluates.
