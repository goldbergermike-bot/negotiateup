#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Senior Software Engineers at ServiceTitan are the technical leaders who own subsystem design decisions, drive code quality standards, and mentor the growing engineering team. As a recently-IPO'd company scaling its engineering organization, Senior SWEs are the backbone of technical execution.

The post-IPO growth stage means ServiceTitan is investing heavily in engineering to capture the massive home services market opportunity. Senior SWEs who can ship reliably while mentoring junior engineers are the force multipliers that enable this scaling — and they command compensation that reflects this leverage.
