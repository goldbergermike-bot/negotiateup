#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Product Managers at ServiceTitan must deeply understand the home services industry — how HVAC companies schedule service calls, how plumbing businesses manage inventory, and how electrical contractors price projects. This domain expertise takes years to develop and is the key to building products that contractors actually adopt and love.

ServiceTitan's post-IPO growth depends on product expansion — new verticals, new features, and new markets. PMs who can identify and prioritize the right opportunities while maintaining deep customer empathy are the growth engine of the company.
