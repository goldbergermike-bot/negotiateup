### Home Services Platform Engineer — ServiceTitan Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: The Home Services Platform Engineer is ServiceTitan's most strategically critical hire — the specialist who combines deep home services domain expertise with platform engineering to build the operating system for the $600B trades industry.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Los Angeles / Glendale (USD) | Atlanta / Secondary (USD) | Remote US (USD) |
|-------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | $145,000–$200,000 | $130,000–$180,000 | $125,000–$170,000 |
| Senior (L5) | $200,000–$265,000 | $180,000–$240,000 | $170,000–$225,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | $265,000–$350,000 | $240,000–$315,000 | $225,000–$295,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants ($70K-$180K/4yr), and 10% performance bonus. This role commands a premium within ServiceTitan's engineering bands due to the combination of home services domain expertise and platform engineering. ServiceTitan (NYSE: TTAN) post-IPO equity with strong growth trajectory.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

The Home Services Platform Engineer role exists because ServiceTitan recognized that building the operating system for the trades industry requires engineers who deeply understand the workflows, constraints, and economics of home services businesses. This is not generic SaaS development — it requires understanding how HVAC technicians schedule calls, how plumbers manage inventory, how electrical contractors price jobs, and how roofing companies coordinate crews.

ServiceTitan's recent IPO validates the thesis that vertical SaaS for home services is a massive, durable business. Home Services Platform Engineers are the people who make this thesis real by building platform capabilities that are deeply tailored to the industry. Your code directly impacts whether a contractor gets the right technician to the right job at the right time — and whether they get paid for it.

The $600B home services market is still deeply underpenetrated by technology. Most contractors still use paper, spreadsheets, or basic software to run their businesses. ServiceTitan's opportunity is to digitize this entire industry, and Home Services Platform Engineers are building the platform that makes it possible.

#### ServiceTitan Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | ServiceTitan Internal Level | Typical YoE | Focus Area |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Home Services Platform Engineer | HSPE (IC4) | 3–5 years | Feature-level platform contributions |
| Senior Home Services Platform Engineer | Sr HSPE (IC5) | 5–8 years | Subsystem ownership, workflow design |
| Staff Home Services Platform Engineer | Staff HSPE (IC6) | 8–12 years | Cross-product platform architecture |
| Principal Home Services Platform Architect | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years | Platform-wide strategy and vision |

*Note: This role maps to premium compensation bands due to the combination of home services domain expertise and platform engineering skills.*

### ServiceTitan Post-IPO Growth & Home Services Platform Premium

As the Home Services Platform Engineer, ServiceTitan's post-IPO growth is your negotiation thesis. The company just proved to the public market that home services software is a category-defining opportunity. You are the engineer building the platform that captures this opportunity.

The home services industry has unique technical challenges: real-time field operations with variable connectivity, complex scheduling optimization across geographic regions, multi-trade workflow management, and integration with equipment manufacturers, supply houses, and financing partners. Home Services Platform Engineers design the systems that solve these challenges at scale.

Use this in every negotiation: "ServiceTitan's IPO validated the home services platform opportunity. I am the engineer who builds the industry-specific platform capabilities that differentiate ServiceTitan from horizontal SaaS competitors. My combination of platform engineering skills and home services domain understanding is the exact skill set that drives ServiceTitan's competitive moat."

#### Global Lever 1: Core Platform & Scheduling Engine

The scheduling and dispatching engine is the heart of the home services platform: "I will design the scheduling system that matches technicians to jobs — optimizing for travel time, skills, customer preferences, and business economics. This is the core platform capability that every contractor depends on, and my home services domain knowledge enables me to build it right."

#### Global Lever 2: Payments & FinTech Integration

Home services payments require industry-specific solutions: "I will build payment and financing workflows that are tailored to how contractors and homeowners transact — from on-site credit card processing to equipment financing to membership plans. My understanding of home services payment flows enables me to design platform capabilities that drive revenue."

#### Global Lever 3: AI & Automation for Home Services

AI for the trades is a greenfield opportunity: "I will build AI features that are deeply tailored to home services — from automated call booking that understands HVAC terminology to predictive maintenance that leverages equipment data to dynamic pricing that accounts for seasonal demand. This industry-specific AI is ServiceTitan's next competitive advantage."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Platform & Analytics

Home services business intelligence: "I will build analytics capabilities that help contractors understand and optimize their businesses — from technician performance dashboards to marketing attribution to revenue forecasting. My understanding of home services business metrics enables me to design analytics that contractors actually use."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $190,000 base with $150,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $245,000 total comp. Cite ServiceTitan's post-IPO growth trajectory, the $600B addressable market, and the premium that home services domain expertise commands. For secondary markets, open at $170,000 base; for remote, open at $160,000 base. Push for larger RSU grants with front-loaded vesting if possible — the post-IPO equity is the primary upside lever.
