#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

ServiceTitan's recent IPO marks a transformational moment for the company and its engineers. As a newly-public company, ServiceTitan is in the unique position of having proven product-market fit in the home services vertical while still operating with the growth-stage urgency that drives premium compensation. The IPO creates a liquid equity market that makes RSU grants immediately valuable, unlike private company options.

ServiceTitan dominates the home services software market — HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, and other trades — serving tens of thousands of contractors across North America. This vertical SaaS model creates deep switching costs and high retention rates, which translates into durable revenue growth and a compelling equity story for engineers.

Software Engineers at ServiceTitan build the end-to-end platform that contractors depend on to run their businesses: scheduling, dispatching, invoicing, payments, marketing, and customer management. Every feature you build directly impacts small business operations and revenue — creating a tangible connection between your code and real-world business outcomes.

| Software Engineer II | SWE II (IC4) | 3–5 years |

### ServiceTitan Post-IPO Growth & Home Services Platform Premium

ServiceTitan's IPO validates the company's position as the category leader in home services software. As a recently-IPO'd company, ServiceTitan offers a unique compensation opportunity: liquid equity with significant growth potential. The home services industry is massive ($600B+ addressable market) and deeply underpenetrated by technology — ServiceTitan is still in the early innings of capturing this opportunity.

The post-IPO moment is your strongest negotiation lever. ServiceTitan needs to retain and attract top engineering talent as it transitions from a private growth-stage company to a public company with quarterly earnings pressure. Engineers who join now get the benefit of liquid equity while the stock is still early in its public market journey.

Use this framing: "ServiceTitan just IPO'd, validating the home services platform thesis. I want to join during this inflection point, when my engineering contributions will have the most impact on the company's public market trajectory. My compensation should reflect both the growth-stage urgency and the public company equity opportunity."

#### Global Lever 1: Core Platform & Scheduling Engine

ServiceTitan's scheduling and dispatching engine is the heartbeat of the platform — matching technicians to jobs in real-time while optimizing for travel time, skills, availability, and customer preferences. Frame your value: "I will build and optimize the scheduling engine that is the core differentiator of ServiceTitan's platform. My experience in [optimization algorithms / real-time systems / distributed computing] directly applies to the most critical system in the home services stack."

#### Global Lever 2: Payments & FinTech Integration

ServiceTitan's payments and financing capabilities are a fast-growing revenue stream. Enabling contractors to process payments, offer financing, and manage invoicing through the platform creates sticky, high-margin revenue: "ServiceTitan's payments and FinTech capabilities are a major growth vector. My experience in [payments infrastructure / financial systems / PCI compliance] positions me to accelerate this high-revenue product area."

#### Global Lever 3: AI & Automation for Home Services

AI is transforming home services — from automated call booking to predictive maintenance to dynamic pricing. ServiceTitan is integrating AI across the platform to help contractors operate more efficiently: "AI-powered features are ServiceTitan's next competitive advantage. My experience with [ML systems / NLP / computer vision] enables me to build intelligent features that differentiate the platform in a rapidly evolving market."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Platform & Analytics

ServiceTitan's data platform enables contractors to make data-driven decisions about their businesses. The analytics stack — from real-time dashboards to predictive business intelligence — is a key differentiator: "I will build the data platform that helps contractors optimize their businesses. My experience in [data infrastructure / analytics systems / real-time dashboards] directly supports ServiceTitan's mission to empower home services businesses with data."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $175,000 base with $120,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $220,000 total comp. Cite ServiceTitan's recent IPO, the $600B addressable market, and the growth-stage equity upside. For Atlanta/secondary markets, open at $155,000 base; for remote roles, open at $145,000 base. Push for larger RSU grants — the post-IPO equity is the primary upside lever.
