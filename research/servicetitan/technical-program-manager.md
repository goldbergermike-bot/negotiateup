#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

TPMs at a recently-IPO'd company manage the intersection of engineering ambition and public market accountability. Every quarterly earnings call creates delivery pressure, and TPMs are the people who ensure engineering programs hit their milestones. ServiceTitan's growth from thousands to hundreds of thousands of contractors requires program management that can coordinate across engineering, product, design, and operations.

#### ServiceTitan Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| Technical Program Manager | TPM (IC4) | 4–7 years |
| Senior TPM | Senior TPM (IC5) | 7–10 years |
| Principal TPM | Principal TPM (IC6) | 10–14 years |

### ServiceTitan Post-IPO Growth & Home Services Platform Premium

TPMs drive post-IPO execution: "I coordinate engineering programs that directly impact ServiceTitan's quarterly results and public market narrative. My program management ensures that the engineering organization delivers on the growth commitments made to investors."

#### Global Lever 1: Core Platform & Scheduling Engine

Core platform programs: "I manage the engineering programs for ServiceTitan's core platform — coordinating scheduling engine improvements, platform migrations, and reliability initiatives across multiple teams."

#### Global Lever 2: Payments & FinTech Integration

FinTech program management: "I coordinate the payments and FinTech programs — managing PCI compliance initiatives, new payment product launches, and financial integration timelines."
