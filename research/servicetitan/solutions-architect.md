#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Solutions Architects at ServiceTitan must understand both enterprise software architecture and the operational realities of home services businesses. You design implementations that integrate ServiceTitan with accounting systems, equipment manufacturers, supply houses, marketing platforms, and financing partners — all while ensuring the solution works for contractors who are not tech-savvy.

The post-IPO growth strategy depends on enterprise deals and multi-location contractor groups — and SAs are the technical leaders who make these complex implementations successful.
