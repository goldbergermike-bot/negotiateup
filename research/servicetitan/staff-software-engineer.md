#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Staff Software Engineers at ServiceTitan are the architectural leaders defining the platform's technical future during the most important phase of the company's growth. The post-IPO period requires Staff-level engineers who can make architectural decisions that scale the platform from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of contractors while maintaining reliability and performance.

As a recently-IPO'd company, ServiceTitan must demonstrate to the public market that it can scale efficiently. Staff engineers who drive architectural improvements that reduce operational costs, improve reliability, and enable faster feature delivery are the key to this narrative.

| External Title | ServiceTitan Internal Level | Typical YoE |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Staff Software Engineer | Staff SWE (IC6) | 8–12 years |
| Senior Staff Software Engineer | Senior Staff (IC6+) | 10–14 years |
| Principal Software Engineer | Principal (IC7) | 12+ years |

### ServiceTitan Post-IPO Growth & Home Services Platform Premium

At Staff level, you define the architectural direction of the entire platform. Frame your negotiation: "I will set the technical architecture for ServiceTitan's platform as the company scales post-IPO. My architectural decisions will determine whether ServiceTitan can efficiently capture the $600B home services market. The equity component of my compensation should reflect the long-term value I create through platform architecture."

#### Global Lever 1: Core Platform & Scheduling Engine

Architectural leadership of core systems: "I will architect the next-generation scheduling and dispatching platform — designing for 10x scale while improving optimization algorithms. This is the technical foundation of ServiceTitan's competitive moat."

#### Global Lever 2: Payments & FinTech Integration

Payments architecture: "I will define the architecture for ServiceTitan's FinTech platform — enabling new payment products, lending partnerships, and financial services that represent the highest-margin growth opportunity."

#### Global Lever 3: AI & Automation for Home Services

AI platform architecture: "I will architect the AI platform that powers intelligent features across ServiceTitan — from call automation to predictive maintenance to dynamic pricing. Building a unified AI platform at this scale requires Staff-level architectural vision."

#### Global Lever 4: Data Platform & Analytics

Data architecture: "I will design the data platform architecture that enables real-time analytics for tens of thousands of contractors — from data ingestion to processing to visualization. This platform is a key competitive differentiator."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $230,000 base with $220,000 in RSUs over 4 years. Your accept-at floor should be $320,000 total comp. Cite your architectural authority, the post-IPO scaling imperative, and competing offers from established public companies. For secondary markets, open at $210,000 base; for remote, open at $200,000 base. Push hard on RSU grants — the post-IPO equity trajectory is the primary upside.
