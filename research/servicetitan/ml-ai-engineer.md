#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

ML/AI Engineers at ServiceTitan have a unique opportunity: applying AI to a massive, data-rich industry that has been largely untouched by modern machine learning. The home services industry generates rich signal data — call recordings, job records, pricing patterns, equipment data, and customer behavior — that is ripe for ML applications but requires domain-specific model development.

ServiceTitan's post-IPO growth strategy relies on AI as a key differentiator. Intelligent features that help contractors operate more efficiently are the product capabilities that drive premium pricing and competitive moat.
