#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at ServiceTitan

Security Engineers at ServiceTitan protect a platform that processes payment data, stores customer PII, and manages business operations for tens of thousands of contractors. As a recently-IPO'd company, ServiceTitan faces heightened security scrutiny from regulators, auditors, and the public market. A security breach would not only impact customers — it would affect the stock price and public market narrative.
