Security Engineers at ServiceTitan protect a platform that processes payment data, stores customer PII, and manages business operations for tens of thousands of contractors. As a recently-IPO'd company, ServiceTitan faces heightened security scrutiny from regulators, auditors, and the public market. A security breach would not only impact customers — it would affect the stock price and public market narrative.

The payments and FinTech expansion adds PCI compliance requirements and financial security obligations that elevate the security engineering function.
