#### Negotiation DNA

Data Engineers at SoFi build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers a full-service financial platform serving 10M+ members. With $1B quarterly revenue and 30% growth outlook, data engineering is the foundation for every data-driven decision at SoFi -- from credit risk models that drive lending economics, to member LTV analytics that shape product strategy, to real-time transaction monitoring that protects revenue. SoFi's integrated platform generates uniquely rich data: a single member's financial lifecycle across lending, banking, investing, and spending creates data pipeline complexity that few companies can match.

SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) adds urgency to data quality and availability: investor metrics, regulatory reporting, and quarterly earnings all depend on reliable data pipelines. Data Engineers who can build real-time, compliant, and scalable data infrastructure across SoFi's product ecosystem and the Galileo BaaS platform (130M+ accounts) are essential to the company's growth strategy.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

Data Engineers build the data foundation that makes LTV acceleration measurable and actionable:

1. **LTV Data Pipeline = Business Intelligence Pipeline:** Every LTV model, every member segmentation, every cross-product recommendation depends on the data pipelines you build. When you improve data freshness from T+1 to real-time, you're not just reducing latency -- you're enabling real-time LTV optimization that lets product and marketing teams act on member behavior as it happens.

2. **Cross-Product Data Integration:** SoFi's competitive advantage is its integrated platform, but that advantage is only real if the data is integrated too. Data engineers who build unified member data models across lending, banking, and investing enable the cross-product analytics that power SoFi's LTV flywheel. Without connected data, the cross-product strategy doesn't work.

3. **Galileo Data Platform:** Data engineers supporting the Galileo BaaS platform build data infrastructure that serves 130M+ accounts across 100+ enterprise clients. Transaction analytics, fraud detection data feeds, and client reporting pipelines are all essential to Galileo's enterprise value proposition and revenue retention.

4. **Regulatory Reporting Infrastructure:** Financial institutions must produce accurate regulatory reports (call reports, HMDA, CRA, suspicious activity reports). Data engineers who build reliable, auditable reporting pipelines protect SoFi's bank charter and regulatory standing -- a compliance function that's existential for the business.

Frame the negotiation: "As a Data Engineer at SoFi, I build the data infrastructure that makes LTV measurement, optimization, and acceleration possible. Without reliable data pipelines, SoFi's cross-product strategy and data-driven decision-making don't function."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Financial Data Platform Experience**
   > "I've built data pipelines for financial platforms handling [X]M+ transactions per day with audit-grade data quality. At SoFi, this financial data engineering expertise means I can build compliant, reliable pipelines from day one -- no learning curve on the regulatory data requirements that banking demands."

2. **Lever: Real-Time Streaming Architecture**
   > "I bring expertise in real-time data streaming (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming) at scale. SoFi's transition from batch to real-time analytics directly enables faster LTV optimization and real-time fraud detection. This real-time data engineering capability justifies $165K+ base."

3. **Lever: Cross-Product Data Modeling**
   > "I've designed unified data models that connect multiple product domains into coherent analytical frameworks. SoFi's integrated platform model specifically requires this cross-product data architecture skill -- building the unified member data layer that powers cross-product analytics and LTV measurement."

4. **Lever: Data Quality & Governance**
   > "I've implemented data quality frameworks that achieved 99.9%+ accuracy for financial reporting. At SoFi's scale, data quality isn't optional -- it's a regulatory requirement and an investor confidence issue. My data governance expertise protects SoFi's quarterly reporting integrity. I'm targeting $200K+ in RSUs."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** With a competing data engineering offer from a peer fintech at $230K+ TC, lead with: "I have a data engineering offer from [Capital One/Block/Plaid] at $242K total comp. SoFi's cross-product data integration challenge is compelling, but I need $165K+ base and $200K+ RSUs over 4 years to close the gap." For candidates with banking regulatory data experience: "My regulatory reporting pipeline experience directly supports SoFi's bank charter compliance -- HMDA, call reports, and SAR filing data infrastructure is specialized knowledge worth $172K base and $220K RSUs." **Accept at $148K+ base and $140K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
