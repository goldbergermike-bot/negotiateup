#### Negotiation DNA

Solutions Architects at SoFi bridge the gap between technical platform capabilities and business requirements across SoFi's integrated financial ecosystem -- lending, banking, investing, Galileo BaaS, and Technisys core banking. With $1B quarterly revenue and 30% growth outlook, Solutions Architects are critical to enabling enterprise client integrations on Galileo, architecting internal platform solutions that span multiple product lines, and ensuring SoFi's technology stack can scale with its aggressive growth targets.

SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) elevates the Solutions Architect role: every architectural recommendation influences build-vs-buy decisions, platform scalability, and the technical foundations that support 10M+ members and 130M+ Galileo accounts. Solutions Architects at SoFi are uniquely positioned at the intersection of consumer fintech, enterprise BaaS, and core banking modernization -- a breadth of scope that few fintech companies can offer.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

Solutions Architects create the integration fabric that makes LTV acceleration scale:

1. **Galileo Enterprise Enablement:** Solutions Architects who design and support Galileo enterprise integrations directly drive BaaS revenue. Each enterprise client integration represents $1M-$10M+ in annual recurring revenue. Your architectural guidance determines integration success rates, time-to-revenue, and client retention -- all direct LTV levers for Galileo's business.

2. **Cross-Platform Architecture:** SoFi's integrated platform model requires architecture that connects lending, banking, investing, and payments into a seamless member experience. Solutions Architects who design these cross-platform integrations enable the multi-product adoption that drives member LTV. Every well-designed API contract and data flow pattern multiplies cross-product engagement.

3. **Technisys Modernization Strategy:** Solutions Architects play a key role in the Technisys core banking platform modernization. Architectural decisions about migration strategies, API design, and system decomposition directly impact the pace of SoFi's platform evolution and its ability to launch new products faster than competitors.

4. **Technical Due Diligence & Risk Mitigation:** Solutions Architects evaluate build-vs-buy decisions, vendor integrations, and technical partnerships. Sound architectural recommendations save millions in avoided technical debt and misaligned integrations. At SoFi's scale, a single poor architectural decision can cost $5M+ in remediation -- your judgment is a risk mitigation asset.

Frame the negotiation: "As a Solutions Architect at SoFi, I design the integration patterns that connect SoFi's product ecosystem and enable Galileo's enterprise revenue. My architectural decisions directly impact the speed and quality of LTV acceleration across the platform."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Enterprise Integration Architecture**
   > "I've designed enterprise integration architectures that supported $XM in annual revenue through client onboarding and platform enablement. At SoFi, this directly maps to Galileo enterprise client integration -- my ability to accelerate time-to-revenue for enterprise clients justifies $175K+ base."

2. **Lever: Financial Platform Architecture**
   > "I bring deep experience architecting systems in regulated financial environments, including banking, payments, and lending platforms. At SoFi, this means I can design compliant, scalable architectures from day one without the 6-month learning curve that banking domain complexity typically requires."

3. **Lever: Cross-Product System Design**
   > "I've architected cross-product integration patterns that increased user engagement by X% across multiple product lines. SoFi's LTV flywheel depends on exactly this type of cross-product architectural thinking -- connecting lending, banking, and investing into seamless member journeys."

4. **Lever: Cloud-Native Platform Modernization**
   > "I've led cloud-native modernization initiatives that reduced infrastructure costs by X% while improving system reliability. This experience directly maps to SoFi's Technisys modernization roadmap -- I can accelerate the core banking platform evolution. I'm targeting $235K+ in RSUs to reflect this strategic impact."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** With a competing SA offer from a cloud provider or fintech at $250K+ TC, lead with: "I have a Solutions Architect offer from [AWS/Azure/Stripe] at $260K total comp. SoFi's combination of consumer fintech, enterprise BaaS, and core banking modernization is a uniquely compelling architectural challenge, but I need $178K+ base and $235K+ RSUs over 4 years to align with market rates." For candidates with Galileo/BaaS integration experience: "My enterprise BaaS integration experience directly accelerates Galileo client onboarding revenue -- that's worth $185K base and $252K RSUs." **Accept at $155K+ base and $155K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
