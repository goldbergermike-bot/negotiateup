#### Negotiation DNA

Engineering Managers at SoFi lead teams that build the financial products and platform infrastructure serving 10M+ members. With SoFi achieving a $1B quarterly revenue record and projecting 30% growth, EMs are accountable for both team velocity and business outcomes -- they must translate LTV acceleration strategy into sprint-level execution across lending, banking, investing, Galileo, or Technisys domains. SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) adds a layer of accountability: engineering decisions directly impact quarterly earnings and investor confidence.

At the EM level, SoFi seeks leaders who can build and retain high-performing teams in the competitive fintech talent market, manage the complexity of financial-grade systems (compliance, reliability, security), and quantify their team's impact in terms of member lifetime value. The dual mandate of people leadership and technical credibility makes this a demanding role with compensation that reflects the breadth of responsibility.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

Engineering Managers amplify the LTV Accelerator loop through team output:

1. **Team Velocity = Revenue Velocity:** An EM who improves team deployment frequency from weekly to daily releases doesn't just improve engineering metrics -- they accelerate the rate at which LTV-driving features reach 10M+ members. At SoFi's 30% growth trajectory, shipping speed directly correlates with revenue capture.

2. **Talent Retention as LTV Protection:** In fintech's competitive hiring market, every senior engineer who stays saves $200K-$500K in replacement costs and 6-12 months of ramp time. An EM who maintains <10% attrition on a 10-person team preserves millions in institutional knowledge and shipping capacity -- knowledge that directly protects SoFi's LTV acceleration engine.

3. **Cross-Product Team Alignment:** EMs at SoFi coordinate engineering efforts across product lines. A manager who effectively aligns their banking team's roadmap with lending and investing initiatives creates cross-product synergies that multiply member LTV beyond what any individual product team could achieve.

4. **Galileo/Technisys Team Scale:** EMs leading Galileo or Technisys teams manage the engineering effort behind SoFi's enterprise revenue stream. Scaling these teams effectively -- hiring, onboarding, and maintaining velocity -- directly impacts the BaaS platform's ability to serve 130M+ accounts and onboard new enterprise clients.

Position the negotiation: "As an EM, my impact is measured in team output, not individual output. I multiply the LTV acceleration capacity of 8-12 engineers, which creates a leverage effect that justifies manager-level compensation premiums."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Team Building Track Record**
   > "I've built and scaled engineering teams from 5 to 15+ engineers while maintaining top-quartile velocity metrics. At SoFi's growth stage with 30% revenue growth, the ability to rapidly scale teams without sacrificing quality is worth a premium -- I'm targeting $235K+ base to reflect that leadership capability."

2. **Lever: Financial Services Engineering Leadership**
   > "I've managed teams building financial-grade systems with SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and regulatory compliance requirements. This fintech management experience means I can lead SoFi teams without a compliance learning curve -- every month of avoided mistakes in financial services engineering saves the company significant regulatory risk."

3. **Lever: Quantified Team Impact**
   > "In my current role, my team shipped features that drove $XM in incremental revenue and reduced churn by Y%. I bring a data-driven management approach that directly aligns with SoFi's LTV acceleration thesis -- I measure my success in member lifetime value impact, not just story points."

4. **Lever: Retention and Culture Economics**
   > "My teams consistently maintain <8% voluntary attrition in a market where fintech engineering turnover averages 15-20%. At SoFi's scale, that retention delta across a 10-person team saves $500K-$1M annually in recruiting and ramp costs. I'd like that value reflected in a $380K+ RSU grant."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** With a competing EM offer from a peer fintech at $350K+ TC, lead with: "I have an EM offer from [Stripe/Robinhood/Block] at $370K total comp. SoFi's cross-platform engineering challenges are compelling, but I need $235K+ base and $380K+ RSUs over 4 years to close the gap." For candidates with Galileo/BaaS platform management experience: "My BaaS engineering leadership experience is directly transferable to Galileo team scaling -- that eliminates management ramp time and justifies $245K base and $420K RSUs." **Accept at $205K+ base and $280K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
