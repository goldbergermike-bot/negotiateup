#### Negotiation DNA

Security Engineers at SoFi protect a chartered bank, publicly traded financial platform, and enterprise BaaS provider -- a scope of security responsibility that rivals the largest financial institutions. With $1B quarterly revenue, 10M+ members, and 130M+ Galileo accounts, the attack surface and regulatory security requirements are immense. Security Engineers are expected to operate across application security, infrastructure security, fraud prevention, identity management, and regulatory compliance (OCC, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GLBA).

SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) means security incidents have immediate market consequences -- a data breach or fraud event would affect stock price, regulatory standing, and member trust simultaneously. This makes Security Engineers among the most strategically critical hires in the organization. The 30% growth outlook amplifies this demand: every new product, member, and enterprise client expands the attack surface that security engineers must defend.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

Security Engineers protect and enable the LTV acceleration engine:

1. **Trust = LTV Foundation:** In financial services, security is the foundation of member trust, and trust is the foundation of lifetime value. A single security incident can destroy years of accumulated member LTV across 10M+ accounts. Security engineers who maintain a clean security posture protect billions in aggregate member lifetime value -- this protective function is the ultimate LTV lever.

2. **Compliance as Competitive Advantage:** SoFi operates under a bank charter with OCC oversight. Security engineers who maintain compliance with banking security regulations don't just avoid penalties -- they enable SoFi to offer products (like FDIC-insured accounts) that non-chartered fintechs cannot. Compliance is a competitive moat, and security engineers are the ones who build and maintain it.

3. **Galileo Enterprise Security:** Enterprise clients choose Galileo BaaS based partly on its security posture. Security engineers who can demonstrate SOC 2 Type II compliance, robust access controls, and comprehensive threat monitoring directly enable enterprise sales. Each enterprise contract represents $1M-$10M+ in annual revenue that depends on security credibility.

4. **Fraud Prevention as Revenue Protection:** Security engineers building fraud detection and prevention systems directly protect revenue. In lending, preventing fraudulent applications saves millions in default losses. In banking, preventing account takeover protects member balances and trust. The ROI of fraud prevention engineering is measurable in direct dollar terms.

Frame the negotiation: "As a Security Engineer at SoFi, I protect the trust foundation that makes member lifetime value possible. Every day without a security incident across 10M+ members and 130M+ Galileo accounts is a day I've protected billions in aggregate LTV."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Financial Security Specialization**
   > "I bring deep expertise in banking and financial services security -- OCC compliance, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, GLBA, and fraud prevention. This specialized knowledge is scarce and essential for a chartered bank like SoFi. Financial security specialists command a premium over generalist security engineers -- I'm targeting $190K+ base."

2. **Lever: Enterprise Security Credibility**
   > "I've built security programs that supported SOC 2 Type II certification and enabled enterprise client acquisition. At Galileo's scale, my ability to maintain and demonstrate enterprise-grade security posture directly enables BaaS revenue growth across 130M+ accounts."

3. **Lever: Incident Response Track Record**
   > "I've managed incident response for platforms serving [X]M+ users with zero data breaches. At SoFi's scale, a clean incident response track record isn't just a resume bullet -- it's worth millions in avoided regulatory fines, legal costs, and member trust erosion."

4. **Lever: Fraud Engineering Expertise**
   > "I've built fraud detection systems that reduced fraud losses by X% while maintaining Y% detection accuracy. At SoFi's lending and banking scale, fraud prevention engineering directly protects revenue and member trust. This specialized expertise is worth $255K+ in RSUs to reflect the revenue protection value."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** With a competing security offer from a financial institution at $270K+ TC, lead with: "I have a security engineering offer from [JPMorgan/Goldman/Stripe] at $280K total comp. SoFi's combination of consumer banking, enterprise BaaS, and growth-stage velocity makes it a compelling security engineering challenge, but I need $190K+ base and $255K+ RSUs over 4 years to align with market rates." For candidates with bank charter security experience: "My OCC-regulated bank security experience means I can maintain SoFi's charter compliance requirements from day one -- that regulatory security expertise is worth $198K base and $275K RSUs." **Accept at $165K+ base and $175K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
