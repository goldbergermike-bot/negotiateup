#### Negotiation DNA

Data Scientists at SoFi are the analytical engine behind a financial platform serving 10M+ members. With $1B quarterly revenue and 30% growth outlook, data scientists are expected to directly drive LTV optimization through member segmentation, credit risk modeling, product recommendation engines, and financial behavior analytics. SoFi's integrated platform model generates uniquely rich data: a single member's lending, banking, investment, and spending behavior across the entire financial lifecycle creates modeling opportunities that single-product fintechs simply cannot match.

SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) means data science outputs directly influence investor presentations, risk disclosures, and growth projections. Data scientists who can quantify member LTV, predict cross-product adoption, and optimize pricing models are among the most strategically valuable individual contributors in the organization.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

Data Scientists power the analytical core of SoFi's LTV acceleration engine:

1. **LTV Modeling = Business Strategy:** Data scientists at SoFi build the member lifetime value models that drive product strategy, marketing spend allocation, and growth projections. When you improve the accuracy of SoFi's LTV prediction model by 10%, you're not just publishing a paper -- you're directly informing $100M+ in business decisions and shaping what gets reported to investors.

2. **Cross-Product Behavioral Analytics:** SoFi's integrated platform generates data on the full financial lifecycle: how members borrow, save, invest, and spend. Data scientists who can extract insights from cross-product behavioral patterns unlock recommendations that drive multi-product adoption -- the single most important lever for member LTV.

3. **Credit Risk Optimization:** In lending, data science IS the product. Improved credit models directly translate to better risk-adjusted returns, lower default rates, and expanded access to credit. A data scientist who improves SoFi's lending model creates value measured in tens of millions of dollars in annual credit performance.

4. **Galileo Analytics Platform:** Data scientists contributing to Galileo's analytics capabilities create enterprise value beyond SoFi. Building fraud detection models, transaction analytics, or risk scoring for the BaaS platform affects 130M+ accounts and generates enterprise revenue.

Frame the negotiation: "As a data scientist at SoFi, I build the analytical models that quantify and optimize member lifetime value -- the core metric that drives SoFi's business strategy and investor confidence."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Financial Modeling Expertise**
   > "I bring deep experience in credit risk modeling, LTV prediction, and financial behavior analytics. At SoFi, these models don't just inform strategy -- they ARE the strategy. My statistical modeling skills directly improve SoFi's lending economics and growth projections, justifying $180K+ base."

2. **Lever: Cross-Product Analytics Capability**
   > "I've built recommendation systems and user segmentation models across multi-product platforms. SoFi's integrated financial platform is the ideal environment for cross-product behavioral analytics -- my ability to extract LTV insights from cross-product data is a rare and valuable skill."

3. **Lever: Production ML Experience**
   > "I don't just build models in notebooks -- I deploy production ML systems that serve real-time predictions at scale. At SoFi's scale of 10M+ members, the ability to operationalize data science into production systems is what separates high-impact DS from research-only roles."

4. **Lever: Regulatory & Explainability Expertise**
   > "In financial services, model explainability and fairness are regulatory requirements, not nice-to-haves. I bring experience building compliant ML models that satisfy CFPB, ECOA, and fair lending requirements. This regulatory data science expertise commands a premium in fintech -- I'm targeting $240K+ in RSUs."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** With a competing DS offer from a peer fintech at $250K+ TC, lead with: "I have a data science offer from [Stripe/Block/Capital One] at $265K total comp. SoFi's cross-product data richness is unmatched for LTV modeling, but I need $180K+ base and $240K+ RSUs over 4 years to close the gap." For candidates with production credit modeling experience: "My credit risk modeling experience directly improves SoFi's lending economics -- conservative estimates suggest my model improvements would be worth $5M+ annually in risk-adjusted returns. That justifies $188K base and $260K RSUs." **Accept at $158K+ base and $165K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
