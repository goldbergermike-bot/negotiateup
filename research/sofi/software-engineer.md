| San Francisco | $135K-$165K | $120K-$200K | 10-15% | $185K-$258K |

#### Negotiation DNA

SoFi Software Engineers operate at the intersection of consumer finance and platform engineering, building products that serve 10M+ members across lending, banking, investing, and the Galileo/Technisys infrastructure stack. With SoFi achieving a $1B quarterly revenue record and projecting 30% growth, every engineer is positioned as an **LTV Accelerator** -- someone whose code directly increases member lifetime value across SoFi's integrated financial ecosystem. The publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) means RSU grants carry genuine liquidity and upside potential tied to the company's aggressive growth trajectory.

At the Software Engineer level, candidates are building foundational features across SoFi's consumer-facing products or contributing to the Galileo Banking-as-a-Service platform that powers 130M+ accounts. The emphasis is on shipping production code that directly impacts member engagement, cross-product adoption, and revenue per user.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

SoFi's financial platform model creates a unique productivity loop that justifies premium compensation:

1. **Member Acquisition Impact:** Every feature you ship across SoFi's lending, banking, or investing products feeds into member growth (10M+ and accelerating). Your code directly drives the top-of-funnel metrics that Wall Street tracks quarterly.

2. **Cross-Product Flywheel:** SoFi's integrated platform means a single well-built feature can increase adoption across multiple products. An engineer who improves the money transfer experience simultaneously boosts banking engagement, lending conversion, and investing onboarding.

3. **Galileo/Technisys Multiplier:** Code contributed to the Galileo BaaS or Technisys core banking platform generates revenue not just from SoFi's own members but from 100+ enterprise clients. Your work has a revenue multiplier effect that pure consumer fintechs cannot match.

4. **Revenue Per Engineer:** With $1B+ quarterly revenue and 30% growth outlook, SoFi's revenue-per-engineer ratio is climbing rapidly. Engineers who can demonstrate direct contribution to LTV metrics command premium positioning in compensation discussions.

Frame every negotiation around this loop: "My work doesn't just build features -- it accelerates member lifetime value across SoFi's entire financial ecosystem, and that LTV compounds across Galileo's enterprise client base."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Galileo Platform Scale**
   > "I bring experience building systems at financial-grade scale. At SoFi, my contributions to the Galileo platform would generate revenue across 130M+ accounts beyond SoFi's own member base -- that multiplier effect justifies positioning me at the top of the band."

2. **Lever: Regulatory & Compliance Complexity**
   > "Financial services engineering requires a specialized skill set around compliance, data privacy, and regulatory frameworks. I've built systems within SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and banking regulatory environments -- this fintech domain expertise commands a premium over general SWE roles."

3. **Lever: Cross-Product LTV Impact**
   > "SoFi's competitive advantage is its integrated platform. I can demonstrate experience building features that drive cross-product adoption -- the exact type of work that increases member LTV and supports SoFi's 30% growth trajectory."

4. **Lever: Public Market RSU Upside**
   > "Given SoFi's public market position at ~$15B+ market cap with 30% revenue growth, I'd like to weight my compensation toward RSUs. I'm confident in the growth thesis, and a larger RSU grant aligns my incentives with the LTV acceleration mission."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** If your competing offer is from a mid-tier tech company at $200K+ TC, lead with: "I have a competing offer at $210K total comp from [Company], but I'm prioritizing SoFi because of the LTV platform thesis. To make this work, I need $155K+ base and $175K+ RSUs over 4 years to close the gap." For candidates with fintech-specific experience, push for the upper quartile: "My regulatory engineering background directly reduces compliance risk for SoFi -- that's worth positioning at $165K base and $200K RSUs." **Accept at $145K+ base and $140K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
