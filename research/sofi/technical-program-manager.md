#### Negotiation DNA

Technical Program Managers at SoFi orchestrate the cross-functional execution of complex technical initiatives across SoFi's integrated financial platform -- spanning lending, banking, investing, Galileo BaaS, and Technisys core banking. With SoFi achieving $1B quarterly revenue and projecting 30% growth, TPMs are the execution backbone that ensures engineering, product, design, compliance, and operations teams deliver LTV-accelerating features on schedule and within regulatory constraints.

SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) adds urgency to program execution: features tied to quarterly earnings commitments must ship on time, platform migrations must execute without disruption, and enterprise client deployments must meet contractual timelines. TPMs who can navigate this intersection of technical complexity, regulatory compliance, and business urgency are essential to SoFi's growth trajectory.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

TPMs enable LTV acceleration through execution excellence:

1. **Cross-Product Program Coordination:** SoFi's most impactful initiatives span multiple product lines -- launching a new financial product requires coordination across lending, banking, investing, compliance, and infrastructure teams. TPMs who can orchestrate these cross-product programs directly accelerate the rate at which LTV-driving features reach 10M+ members.

2. **Galileo Enterprise Delivery:** TPMs managing Galileo enterprise client deployments directly influence BaaS revenue timing. Delivering an enterprise integration 2 weeks ahead of schedule means 2 weeks of additional revenue capture. At Galileo's contract values, program acceleration translates to millions in time-value of revenue.

3. **Regulatory Program Navigation:** Financial product launches require regulatory approvals, compliance reviews, and audit preparations. TPMs who can integrate these regulatory workstreams into technical program timelines -- rather than treating compliance as a blocker -- ship products faster while maintaining the regulatory standing required of a chartered bank.

4. **Technisys Migration Execution:** The Technisys core banking platform modernization is one of SoFi's most complex multi-year technical programs. TPMs driving this migration manage the risk of platform transitions that affect every product line and 10M+ members. Flawless execution of this migration is worth billions in preserved member trust and platform capability.

Frame the negotiation: "As a TPM at SoFi, I don't write the code -- I ensure the right code ships at the right time to the right members. My execution capability is the multiplier that converts engineering investment into LTV acceleration at scale."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Cross-Functional Program Leadership**
   > "I've managed programs spanning 5+ engineering teams with 50+ engineers, delivering complex multi-quarter initiatives on time. At SoFi's scale with cross-product dependencies, this large-scale program management capability is essential -- I'm targeting $165K+ base to reflect the scope of execution responsibility."

2. **Lever: Fintech Regulatory Program Experience**
   > "I've navigated program execution in regulated financial environments, integrating compliance reviews, audit requirements, and regulatory approvals into technical delivery timelines. At SoFi, this means faster time-to-market for financial products without compliance risk -- a capability that's worth a premium."

3. **Lever: Platform Migration Expertise**
   > "I've led complex platform migration programs that transitioned [X]M+ users from legacy to modern systems with zero downtime. This directly maps to SoFi's Technisys core banking modernization -- my migration program experience reduces execution risk on one of SoFi's most critical technical initiatives."

4. **Lever: Enterprise Delivery Track Record**
   > "I've managed enterprise client deployment programs that directly impacted revenue timing and client satisfaction. At Galileo's scale, my ability to accelerate enterprise integrations translates directly to BaaS revenue acceleration. I'm targeting $200K+ in RSUs to reflect this revenue impact."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** With a competing TPM offer from a peer tech company at $230K+ TC, lead with: "I have a TPM offer from [Google/Amazon/Stripe] at $245K total comp. SoFi's cross-product technical program complexity is genuinely more challenging, but I need $165K+ base and $200K+ RSUs over 4 years to close the gap." For candidates with fintech regulatory program experience: "My regulatory program management experience means SoFi's compliance-integrated delivery model isn't new to me -- I can drive cross-product launches without the learning curve. That's worth $172K base and $220K RSUs." **Accept at $148K+ base and $145K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor.**
