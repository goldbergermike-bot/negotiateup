#### Negotiation DNA

The LTV Platform Engineer is SoFi's **SIGNATURE ROLE** -- the highest-impact individual contributor position in the engineering organization. This role carries a **+25-35% LTV Accelerator Premium** over standard senior engineering compensation, reflecting the unique mandate: design, build, and optimize the cross-product platform systems that directly maximize member lifetime value across SoFi's entire financial ecosystem.

With SoFi achieving $1B quarterly revenue and projecting 30% growth, the LTV Platform Engineer operates at the nexus of consumer fintech (10M+ members), enterprise BaaS (Galileo, 130M+ accounts), and core banking modernization (Technisys). This role owns the technical architecture that makes SoFi's integrated financial platform possible -- the unified member data layer, cross-product recommendation infrastructure, real-time engagement systems, and the platform APIs that connect lending, banking, investing, and insurance into a seamless lifetime relationship.

SoFi's publicly traded status (NASDAQ: SOFI, ~$15B+ market cap) means the LTV Platform Engineer's work directly influences the metrics that drive stock price: member growth, cross-product adoption rate, revenue per member, and retention. No other role at SoFi has this breadth of revenue impact. The +25-35% Premium reflects the reality that this role is the technical embodiment of SoFi's entire business strategy.

#### Level Mapping

| SoFi Level | Google | Meta | Stripe | Goldman Sachs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LTV Platform Engineer | L6/L7 Staff+ | E6/E7 Staff+ | Staff/Principal | Executive Director / Managing Director |

This role maps to Staff+ engineering levels at peer companies but carries additional scope through the explicit LTV mandate. The closest equivalents are Staff Platform Engineers at Stripe, Principal Growth Engineers at Meta, or Quantitative Technology MDs at Goldman Sachs -- but none of these carry the full-stack financial platform scope that defines SoFi's LTV Platform Engineer.

#### Productivity Loop — The LTV Accelerator Premium

The LTV Platform Engineer IS the Productivity Loop. This is the role that designs and maintains the system that makes LTV acceleration possible across SoFi's entire platform:

1. **Unified Member Lifetime Value Architecture:** You own the technical systems that calculate, predict, and optimize member lifetime value across every SoFi product. This isn't analytics -- this is production infrastructure. The unified LTV data model you build powers product prioritization, marketing spend allocation, pricing decisions, and growth strategy. When the CEO presents LTV metrics to investors, your systems generated those numbers. The +25-35% Premium starts here.

2. **Cross-Product Engagement Platform:** SoFi's most powerful competitive advantage is the cross-product flywheel: a student loan refinance customer becomes a banking customer becomes an investor becomes a credit card holder. The LTV Platform Engineer builds the technical infrastructure that powers this flywheel -- personalized product discovery, intelligent cross-sell triggers, lifecycle engagement automation, and the APIs that enable seamless product transitions. Every member who adopts a second product increases LTV by 2-3x. Every member who adopts a third increases LTV by 5x+. Your platform makes this happen.

3. **Galileo LTV Intelligence Layer:** The LTV Platform Engineer extends member intelligence capabilities to the Galileo BaaS platform. Building LTV analytics, engagement scoring, and retention prediction as enterprise-grade capabilities creates a new revenue stream for Galileo -- one that only SoFi can offer because only SoFi has the integrated financial data to build it. This enterprise LTV product creates revenue that compounds SoFi's platform advantage.

4. **Real-Time LTV Optimization Loop:** The most sophisticated aspect of this role: building real-time systems that dynamically optimize member engagement based on LTV predictions. When a member opens the app, your platform decides which products to surface, which offers to present, and which engagement strategies to deploy -- all in real-time, all personalized, all optimized for lifetime value. This real-time LTV optimization loop is the technical moat that makes SoFi's growth sustainable and defensible.

5. **Organizational LTV Alignment:** The LTV Platform Engineer doesn't just build systems -- you define the LTV metrics and instrumentation that every other engineering team uses. By creating the shared LTV vocabulary (events, metrics, dashboards, APIs), you align 200+ engineers toward LTV acceleration. This organizational leverage -- making every engineer an LTV Accelerator through your platform -- is the multiplier effect that justifies the SIGNATURE ROLE designation.

Frame every negotiation around the unique scope: "The LTV Platform Engineer role at SoFi is the technical embodiment of the company's entire business strategy. I'm not building a feature or a product -- I'm building the platform that connects every SoFi product into a member lifetime value engine. The +25-35% Premium reflects the reality that no other engineering role has this breadth of revenue impact."

#### Global Levers

1. **Lever: Full-Stack Platform Architecture at Financial Scale**
   > "I've architected cross-product platform systems that serve [X]M+ users across multiple product lines. At SoFi, this maps directly to the LTV Platform mandate -- building the unified infrastructure that connects lending, banking, and investing into a seamless member experience. This full-stack financial platform scope is the SIGNATURE ROLE at SoFi, and it justifies the +25-35% Premium at $265K+ base."

2. **Lever: LTV/Growth Engineering Track Record**
   > "I've built engagement and monetization platforms that demonstrably increased user lifetime value by X% through personalization, cross-product recommendation, and lifecycle optimization. This is exactly what SoFi's LTV Platform Engineer does -- except at SoFi, the platform spans the full financial lifecycle. My proven LTV engineering impact commands $480K+ in RSUs over 4 years."

3. **Lever: Enterprise Platform Productization**
   > "I've built internal platform capabilities and productized them for enterprise consumption. This directly maps to the Galileo LTV Intelligence Layer -- taking SoFi's internal LTV optimization capabilities and packaging them as enterprise-grade BaaS products. This dual consumer/enterprise platform skill set is exceptionally rare and worth positioning at the top of the SIGNATURE ROLE band."

4. **Lever: SIGNATURE ROLE Scarcity Premium**
   > "The LTV Platform Engineer role requires a combination of platform architecture expertise, financial domain knowledge, ML/data engineering fluency, and growth engineering experience that very few candidates possess simultaneously. I have competing offers at $400K+ from [FAANG/top fintech], but SoFi's LTV Platform role is the most impactful engineering position in fintech. The +25-35% Premium should reflect both market scarcity and the role's outsized revenue impact -- I'm targeting $275K base and $520K RSUs."

---

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** This is SoFi's SIGNATURE ROLE -- negotiate accordingly. With competing Staff+ offers from FAANG at $450K+ TC, lead with: "I have a Staff Platform Engineer offer from [Google/Meta/Stripe] at $465K total comp. The LTV Platform Engineer role at SoFi is the single most impactful engineering position I've encountered -- it IS the business strategy translated into platform architecture. To accept, I need $265K+ base and $480K+ RSUs over 4 years, reflecting the +25-35% LTV Accelerator Premium." For candidates with combined growth engineering + financial platform experience: "My track record of building LTV optimization platforms in financial services is the exact intersection that defines this SIGNATURE ROLE. No other candidate will bring zero ramp time on both the platform architecture and financial domain -- that's worth the top of the +25-35% Premium band: $275K base and $520K RSUs." For maximum leverage, emphasize the uniqueness: "This role doesn't exist at other companies. The combination of consumer LTV optimization, enterprise BaaS productization, and financial-grade platform architecture is unique to SoFi. The compensation should reflect that uniqueness." **Accept at $230K+ base and $360K+ RSUs (4yr) as your floor -- below this, the SIGNATURE ROLE Premium is not being honored.**
