*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups fundamentally reshaped the company's engineering roadmap. Software Engineers who join now are not simply writing code for legacy firewall products — they are building the infrastructure that powers the Agentic AI Stack, a platform designed to autonomously detect, triage, and remediate threats across Check Point's entire product portfolio. The Four Pillars strategy (Infinity Platform, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum) demands engineers who can work across all four domains simultaneously.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition means Check Point is in an aggressive hiring mode, absorbing three separate engineering cultures while scaling its Agentic AI Stack capabilities. This creates a supply-demand imbalance that favors candidates. Software Engineers with experience in AI/ML pipelines, distributed systems, or cloud-native security architectures can command significant premiums above published bands.

CHKP trades on NASDAQ at roughly $200/share with a market cap exceeding $22B. RSU grants vest over four years on a standard schedule, and the company's post-acquisition trajectory suggests meaningful stock appreciation, making RSU packages a critical negotiation lever.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. As a Software Engineer candidate, you should negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. The Agentic AI Stack unifies autonomous threat detection, automated remediation, and predictive analytics into a single platform layer that spans all Four Pillars — Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 brought specialized capabilities in natural language threat intelligence, autonomous SOC operations, and real-time adversarial ML detection. Software Engineers are expected to integrate these capabilities into the existing product suite, a task that requires deep systems expertise and AI fluency. This integration workload will persist through at least 2028, making retention a top priority for Check Point's engineering leadership.

Use this language in negotiations: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to accelerate integration timelines across all Four Pillars."

The Agentic AI Stack is not a single product — it is a horizontal platform layer. Software Engineers who can demonstrate cross-pillar competence (e.g., building services that span CloudGuard and Harmony simultaneously) are especially valuable and should push for top-of-band RSU grants.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

Check Point's Infinity Platform is the unified management and threat intelligence layer that connects all Four Pillars. Software Engineers working on Infinity build the APIs, data pipelines, and orchestration services that make consolidated security possible. In negotiations, emphasize: "My experience building platform-level services directly accelerates Infinity's ability to operationalize the Agentic AI Stack across every Check Point product. The February 13, 2026 acquisitions added three new integration surfaces that need platform engineering talent."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard protects multi-cloud and hybrid environments with workload protection, posture management, and application security. Software Engineers contributing to CloudGuard should highlight cloud-native expertise: "CloudGuard's expansion into AI-powered workload protection — enabled by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — requires engineers who understand both cloud infrastructure and the Agentic AI Stack. My background in cloud-native architecture directly maps to CloudGuard's 2026 roadmap under the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony secures endpoints, email, and remote access. Software Engineers on Harmony build the agents, browser extensions, and SASE components that protect distributed workforces. Negotiation language: "Harmony's integration with the Agentic AI Stack — particularly the autonomous endpoint remediation capabilities from the February 13, 2026 acquisitions — demands engineers who can ship reliable, performant client-side software. My track record of building secure endpoint agents justifies a premium within the Four Pillars framework."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum encompasses Check Point's next-generation firewalls, SD-WAN, and IoT security appliances. Software Engineers on Quantum work at the intersection of high-performance networking and AI-driven threat prevention. Cite in negotiations: "Quantum's integration of Agentic AI Stack capabilities for real-time inline threat prevention — a direct outcome of the 3 AI startups acquired on Feb 13, 2026 — requires engineers with low-latency systems expertise. The Four Pillars strategy elevates Quantum from a firewall product to an AI-powered network defense platform."
