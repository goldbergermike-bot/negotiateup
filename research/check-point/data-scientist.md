#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups brought an influx of ML models, training datasets, and inference pipelines that need to be integrated into the company's security products. Data Scientists are the bridge between raw threat intelligence data and the actionable predictions that power the Agentic AI Stack across all Four Pillars.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition dramatically expanded Check Point's data assets — each acquired startup brought proprietary datasets covering different threat domains. Data Scientists who can unify these datasets, retrain models for Check Point's customer base, and deploy them at scale across the Four Pillars are essential to the Agentic AI Stack's success.

With CHKP at ~$200/share on NASDAQ and a market cap exceeding $22B, RSU grants for Data Scientists (typically 1,000-3,000 shares vesting over four years) carry substantial value. Candidates with cybersecurity domain expertise combined with strong ML skills should negotiate for premiums of 15-25% above standard bands.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. Data Scientists are the ML backbone of the Agentic AI Stack — they build the models that detect threats, predict attacks, and enable autonomous remediation across all Four Pillars.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 each specialized in different AI/ML domains: NLP-based threat intelligence parsing, autonomous SOC triage models, and adversarial ML detection. Data Scientists must integrate, retrain, and optimize these models for Check Point's unified Agentic AI Stack platform serving Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum.

Use this in negotiations: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to build production ML models for autonomous cybersecurity at enterprise scale."

The Four Pillars strategy creates unique data science challenges: each pillar generates different types of security telemetry, and the Agentic AI Stack must reason across all of them simultaneously. Data Scientists who can build cross-domain models are especially valuable.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

Data Scientists on Infinity build the cross-pillar analytics and threat correlation models that power the Agentic AI Stack's unified threat detection. Negotiate: "Infinity's consolidated analytics engine must integrate models from three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026. My experience building cross-domain ML models directly enables the Four Pillars strategy's unified approach."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard Data Scientists build models for cloud workload anomaly detection, misconfig prediction, and automated posture remediation. Leverage: "CloudGuard's AI-driven cloud security — powered by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — requires Data Scientists who can build cloud-native Agentic AI Stack models at scale under the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony Data Scientists build endpoint threat detection models, email security classifiers, and user behavior analytics. State: "Harmony's autonomous endpoint defense following the February 13, 2026 acquisitions requires Data Scientists who can build lightweight, on-device ML models for the Agentic AI Stack within the Four Pillars framework."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum Data Scientists build inline threat detection models that run at wire speed in firewalls and network appliances. Negotiate: "Quantum's AI-powered network threat prevention from the three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026, needs Data Scientists who can optimize Agentic AI Stack models for real-time inference under the Four Pillars strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $220,000 base with 1,400 RSUs ($280,000 at CHKP ~$200). Accept-at floor: $410,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 triple AI startup acquisition, the Four Pillars strategy, and your Agentic AI Stack defense expertise.
