### ML/AI Engineer — Check Point Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: ML/AI Engineers at Check Point are the technical core of the Agentic AI Stack, building the autonomous threat detection and remediation models that power all Four Pillars and command the highest premiums in cybersecurity.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) | San Carlos (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | ₪440,000–₪580,000 | $170,000–$215,000 | £78,000–£100,000 |
| Senior (L5) | ₪580,000–₪760,000 | $225,000–$300,000 | £105,000–£140,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | ₪720,000–₪950,000 | $285,000–$380,000 | £125,000–£172,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups was fundamentally an ML/AI talent play. The company acquired NLP models, autonomous SOC agents, and adversarial ML detection systems — all of which need ML/AI Engineers to integrate, scale, and evolve within the Agentic AI Stack framework. ML/AI Engineers sit at the intersection of the company's biggest strategic bet and the industry's most competitive talent market.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition brought proprietary models, training infrastructure, and ML expertise that must be unified into a coherent Agentic AI Stack serving all Four Pillars. ML/AI Engineers who can work across model architectures (transformers, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning) and application domains (threat detection, incident response, adversarial defense) command premiums of 20-35% above standard engineering bands.

With CHKP at ~$200/share on NASDAQ and a $22B+ market cap, RSU grants for ML/AI Engineers (typically 1,500-4,000 shares vesting over four years) represent significant compensation. The scarcity of ML/AI engineers with cybersecurity domain expertise makes this one of the most favorable negotiating positions in the industry.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| ML/AI Engineer | ML Engineer (L3-L4) | 2-5 |
| Senior ML/AI Engineer | Senior ML Engineer (L5) | 5-8 |
| Staff ML/AI Engineer | Staff ML Engineer (L6) | 8-12 |
| Principal ML/AI Engineer | Principal ML Engineer (L7) | 12+ |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. ML/AI Engineers are not supporting players in this transformation — they ARE the transformation. Every autonomous capability in the Agentic AI Stack is built by ML/AI Engineers.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 brought three distinct ML specializations: NLP-based threat intelligence (transformers for malware analysis, phishing detection, and threat report parsing), autonomous SOC operations (reinforcement learning agents for incident triage and response), and adversarial ML detection (robust models that detect and counter adversarial attacks). ML/AI Engineers must unify these into a coherent model architecture serving all Four Pillars — Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum.

Use this language: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to build, train, and deploy autonomous ML systems for enterprise cybersecurity at scale."

The Four Pillars strategy demands ML/AI Engineers who can build models optimized for different deployment targets: cloud inference for Infinity and CloudGuard, edge inference for Harmony endpoints, and inline wire-speed inference for Quantum appliances. This breadth of deployment expertise is rare and highly valuable.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

ML/AI Engineers on Infinity build the cross-pillar ML models — threat correlation, anomaly detection, and autonomous triage — that power the Agentic AI Stack's brain. Negotiate: "Infinity's ML platform must unify models from three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026. My experience building production ML platforms directly enables the Four Pillars strategy's autonomous security vision."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard ML/AI Engineers build models for cloud workload anomaly detection, misconfiguration prediction, and autonomous remediation. Leverage: "CloudGuard's AI-driven cloud security — powered by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — requires ML Engineers who can build Agentic AI Stack models for cloud-native threat detection at scale under the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony ML/AI Engineers build lightweight models for on-device threat detection, email classification, and user behavior analytics. State: "Harmony's autonomous endpoint defense from the February 13, 2026 acquisitions requires ML Engineers who can build edge-optimized Agentic AI Stack models within the Four Pillars framework."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum ML/AI Engineers build models that run inline at wire speed in firewalls and network appliances. Negotiate: "Quantum's real-time AI threat prevention from the three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026, requires ML Engineers who can optimize Agentic AI Stack models for microsecond-latency inference under the Four Pillars strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $275,000 base with 2,500 RSUs ($500,000 at CHKP ~$200). Accept-at floor: $520,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 triple AI startup acquisition, the Four Pillars strategy, and your Agentic AI Stack defense expertise.
