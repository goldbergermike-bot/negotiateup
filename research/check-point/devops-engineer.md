*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups tripled the company's infrastructure footprint overnight. Three separate CI/CD pipelines, three separate cloud environments, and three separate monitoring stacks must be consolidated into a unified platform that supports the Agentic AI Stack across all Four Pillars. DevOps Engineers who can execute this consolidation while maintaining uptime and deployment velocity are in critical demand.

The Feb 13, 2026 acquisitions created an infrastructure integration challenge that will take 12-18 months to fully resolve. DevOps Engineers are on the front lines of this work — migrating workloads, standardizing toolchains, and building the deployment automation that allows the Agentic AI Stack to ship features across Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum simultaneously.

CHKP's $22B+ market cap and ~$200/share NASDAQ price make RSU grants (typically 800-2,500 shares vesting over four years for DevOps) a meaningful compensation component. Candidates with multi-cloud infrastructure experience and CI/CD expertise should negotiate for above-band RSU packages.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. DevOps Engineers build the infrastructure backbone that makes the Agentic AI Stack operational — the Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, and deployment automation that keep autonomous security services running at enterprise scale.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 each ran on different infrastructure stacks. DevOps Engineers must consolidate these into a unified platform that supports the Agentic AI Stack across all Four Pillars while meeting Check Point's stringent availability and security requirements.

Use this leverage in negotiations: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to consolidate and scale infrastructure for AI-powered security platforms."

The Four Pillars strategy requires DevOps Engineers who can build infrastructure that serves multiple product lines simultaneously. The Agentic AI Stack's inference workloads, data pipelines, and model serving infrastructure must be deployed consistently across Tel Aviv, San Carlos, and global edge locations.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

DevOps Engineers on Infinity build the platform infrastructure — multi-region Kubernetes clusters, service mesh, and observability stack — that serves all Four Pillars. Negotiate: "Infinity's platform infrastructure must support three newly acquired systems from the February 13, 2026 acquisitions. My experience building multi-tenant platform infrastructure directly enables the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard DevOps Engineers manage the multi-cloud deployment infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Leverage: "CloudGuard's expansion to support Agentic AI Stack workloads — enabled by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — requires DevOps expertise in multi-cloud AI infrastructure under the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony DevOps Engineers manage the build, release, and update infrastructure for endpoint agents, browser extensions, and SASE edge nodes. State: "Harmony's autonomous endpoint defense following the February 13, 2026 acquisitions needs DevOps engineers who can manage client-side deployment at scale for the Agentic AI Stack within the Four Pillars framework."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum DevOps Engineers manage the firmware build systems, appliance provisioning, and update infrastructure for network security products. Negotiate: "Quantum's integration of AI models from the three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026, requires DevOps expertise in embedded ML deployment for the Agentic AI Stack under the Four Pillars strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $190,000 base with 900 RSUs ($180,000 at CHKP ~$200). Accept-at floor: $350,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 triple AI startup acquisition, the Four Pillars strategy, and your Agentic AI Stack defense expertise.
