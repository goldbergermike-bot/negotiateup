#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups introduced new attack surfaces, new code, and new infrastructure that must meet Check Point's security standards — the same standards that enterprise customers rely on to protect their organizations. Security Engineers are responsible for auditing, testing, and securing the Agentic AI Stack across all Four Pillars, making them a critical control point in the post-acquisition integration.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition brought AI systems that are inherently new attack vectors: adversarial ML attacks, prompt injection, data poisoning, and model theft are all risks that traditional security engineering practices do not fully address. Security Engineers who understand both classical application security and AI/ML security are in extremely high demand.

CHKP trades at ~$200/share on NASDAQ with a $22B+ market cap. RSU grants for Security Engineers (typically 1,000-3,000 shares vesting over four years) are a core compensation component. Candidates with AI security expertise, red team experience, or offensive security backgrounds should negotiate for premiums of 15-25% above standard bands.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Security Engineer | Security Engineer (L3-L4) | 2-5 |
| Senior Security Engineer | Senior Security Engineer (L5) | 5-8 |
| Staff Security Engineer | Staff Security Engineer (L6) | 8-12 |
| Principal Security Architect | Principal Security (L7) | 12+ |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. Security Engineers ensure that the Agentic AI Stack itself is secure — they perform threat modeling, penetration testing, and security architecture review for the autonomous AI systems that protect Check Point's customers across all Four Pillars.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 introduced ML models, training pipelines, and inference services that all require security review and hardening. Security Engineers must assess these systems for adversarial ML vulnerabilities, data pipeline integrity, model supply chain risks, and autonomous decision-making safety across Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum.

Use this positioning: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to secure AI/ML systems against adversarial threats — defending the defender."

The Four Pillars strategy requires Security Engineers who can work across product boundaries. The Agentic AI Stack's security posture is only as strong as its weakest pillar, making cross-pillar security expertise essential.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

Security Engineers on Infinity secure the cross-pillar platform — APIs, authentication, authorization, and data sharing layers that connect all Four Pillars. Negotiate: "Infinity's platform security must account for three new integration surfaces from the February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups. My experience securing multi-tenant platforms directly supports the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard Security Engineers secure the cloud security products themselves — ensuring that the tools customers use to protect their clouds are not vulnerable to attack. Leverage: "CloudGuard's AI-powered cloud security — enabled by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — introduces Agentic AI Stack components that need adversarial ML security review under the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony Security Engineers secure endpoint agents, browser extensions, and SASE components — client-side software that runs on customer devices with elevated privileges. State: "Harmony's autonomous endpoint agents from the February 13, 2026 acquisitions introduce new Agentic AI Stack attack surfaces on customer endpoints. Securing these within the Four Pillars framework requires specialized expertise."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum Security Engineers secure firmware, management planes, and inline AI inference engines in network security appliances. Negotiate: "Quantum's integration of AI models from the three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026, introduces new Agentic AI Stack attack surfaces in network appliances under the Four Pillars strategy."
