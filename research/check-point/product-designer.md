### Product Designer — Check Point Salary Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA**: Product Designers at Check Point shape the user experience of the Agentic AI Stack and Four Pillars product portfolio, translating autonomous security capabilities into intuitive interfaces for enterprise security teams.

#### Compensation Benchmarks (2026)

| Level | Tel Aviv (ILS ₪) | San Carlos (USD) | London (GBP £) |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mid (L3-L4) | ₪370,000–₪490,000 | $140,000–$180,000 | £65,000–£85,000 |
| Senior (L5) | ₪490,000–₪640,000 | $185,000–$240,000 | £85,000–£115,000 |
| Staff+ (L6+) | ₪600,000–₪770,000 | $230,000–$300,000 | £100,000–£140,000 |

*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups created an enormous UX integration challenge. Three separate product experiences — each with distinct design languages, interaction patterns, and user mental models — must be unified into the Agentic AI Stack interface layer that spans all Four Pillars. Product Designers who can harmonize these experiences while making autonomous AI-driven security accessible to enterprise SOC teams are in critical demand.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition means Check Point's design team must rethink how security professionals interact with AI-powered tools. The Agentic AI Stack introduces autonomous decision-making into workflows that traditionally required human approval at every step. Product Designers must create trust, transparency, and control in these new autonomous interfaces — a design challenge that few companies have solved at enterprise scale.

CHKP's NASDAQ listing at ~$200/share with a $22B+ market cap means RSU grants (typically 800-2,000 shares vesting over four years for designers) represent meaningful compensation. Designers with experience in AI/ML interfaces, security dashboards, or enterprise platforms should negotiate for above-band RSU packages.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Product Designer | Designer (L3-L4) | 2-5 |
| Senior Product Designer | Senior Designer (L5) | 5-8 |
| Staff Product Designer | Staff Designer (L6) | 8-12 |
| Design Lead / Director | Design Director (L7) | 12+ |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. Product Designers define how security teams experience the Agentic AI Stack — they design the dashboards, workflows, and interaction patterns that determine whether autonomous AI security is trusted and adopted by enterprise customers.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 each had their own design systems and UX patterns. Product Designers must create a unified design language for the Agentic AI Stack that works consistently across all Four Pillars — Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum — while preserving the best interaction patterns from each acquired product.

Use this framing in negotiations: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to design trustworthy, intuitive interfaces for autonomous security systems."

The Four Pillars strategy requires Product Designers who can think systemically — creating design patterns and component libraries that scale across Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum while maintaining consistency with the Agentic AI Stack experience.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

Infinity's consolidated security dashboard is the primary interface for enterprise CISOs and SOC teams. Product Designers on Infinity create the cross-pillar experience that makes the Agentic AI Stack accessible. Negotiate: "Infinity's unified dashboard must integrate three acquired product experiences from the February 13, 2026 acquisitions into a single coherent interface. My experience designing enterprise platform UX directly maps to this Four Pillars integration challenge."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard's cloud security interfaces must present complex multi-cloud security posture data in actionable formats. Leverage: "CloudGuard's AI-powered cloud protection — enabled by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — requires designers who can visualize autonomous cloud security decisions within the Agentic AI Stack. The Four Pillars strategy makes CloudGuard UX a top priority."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony's endpoint and access products serve end users directly. Designers create the lightweight, non-intrusive interfaces that secure without disrupting productivity. State: "Harmony's autonomous endpoint defense following the February 13, 2026 acquisitions requires a designer who can make Agentic AI Stack decisions transparent to end users within the Four Pillars framework."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum's network security interfaces serve network operations teams managing firewalls, SD-WAN, and IoT security. Negotiate: "Quantum's AI-powered network defense from the three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026, needs a designer who can visualize real-time Agentic AI Stack threat prevention for network teams under the Four Pillars strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $175,000 base with 900 RSUs ($180,000 at CHKP ~$200). Accept-at floor: $320,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 triple AI startup acquisition, the Four Pillars strategy, and your Agentic AI Stack defense expertise.
