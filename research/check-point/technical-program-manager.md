#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups created the most complex cross-functional program in the company's history. Technical Program Managers must coordinate engineering, product, design, and go-to-market teams across three acquired companies and four product pillars to deliver the Agentic AI Stack on an aggressive timeline. The Four Pillars strategy (Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, Quantum) demands TPMs who can manage dependencies, resolve conflicts, and maintain execution velocity across dozens of workstreams.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition means TPMs are managing integration programs that span Tel Aviv, San Carlos, and the locations of the three acquired companies. This geographic and organizational complexity requires experienced program managers who can operate across time zones, cultures, and organizational boundaries while keeping the Agentic AI Stack delivery on track.

CHKP's $22B+ market cap and ~$200/share NASDAQ price mean RSU grants (typically 1,000-2,800 shares vesting over four years for TPMs) are a significant compensation component. Candidates with experience managing large-scale integration programs or AI platform delivery should negotiate for above-band packages.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Technical Program Manager | TPM (L4) | 3-6 |
| Senior Technical Program Manager | Senior TPM (L5) | 6-10 |
| Staff / Principal TPM | Staff TPM (L6) | 10-14 |
| Director of Program Management | Director TPM (L7) | 14+ |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. Technical Program Managers are the execution engine that turns the Agentic AI Stack vision into shipped products — they manage the timelines, dependencies, risks, and cross-team coordination that determine whether the integration succeeds or stalls.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 each had their own roadmaps, milestones, and delivery cadences. TPMs must integrate these into a unified program plan that delivers Agentic AI Stack capabilities across all Four Pillars — Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum — on a timeline that satisfies both customers and investors.
