*Total compensation includes base salary, RSU grants (4-year vest), and performance bonus.*

#### Negotiation DNA — Why This Role Commands a Premium at Check Point

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups brought massive data assets — threat intelligence feeds, training datasets, customer telemetry, and model artifacts — that must be unified into a single data platform powering the Agentic AI Stack. Data Engineers who can build the pipelines, lakes, and warehouses that make this data accessible across all Four Pillars are critical to the company's post-acquisition success.

The Feb 13, 2026 triple acquisition means Check Point now has three separate data architectures, three separate data quality standards, and three separate data governance frameworks. Data Engineers must consolidate these into a unified data platform that serves ML training, real-time inference, analytics, and reporting for the Agentic AI Stack across Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, and Quantum.

CHKP's NASDAQ listing at ~$200/share and $22B+ market cap make RSU grants (typically 900-2,500 shares vesting over four years for Data Engineers) a substantial compensation component. Candidates with experience building data platforms for ML/AI workloads should negotiate for above-band RSU packages.

#### Check Point Level Mapping & Internal Titles

| External Title | Check Point Internal | Typical YOE |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Data Engineer | Data Engineer (L3-L4) | 2-5 |
| Senior Data Engineer | Senior Data Engineer (L5) | 5-8 |
| Staff Data Engineer | Staff Data Engineer (L6) | 8-12 |

### 🤖 Check Point Agentic AI Stack & Four Pillars Lever

Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot. Data Engineers are the foundation layer — without reliable, scalable data pipelines, the Agentic AI Stack's ML models cannot train, infer, or learn. Every pillar depends on the data infrastructure that Data Engineers build and maintain.

The 3 AI startups acquired on February 13, 2026 each generated and consumed data differently. Data Engineers must build a unified data platform that ingests threat intelligence from all four pillars (Infinity, CloudGuard, Harmony, Quantum), feeds ML training pipelines, serves real-time inference, and supports analytics — all while maintaining data quality, lineage, and governance at scale.

Use this framing: "Check Point's February 13, 2026 acquisition of three AI startups and new Four Pillars strategy positions the Agentic AI Stack as the next evolution of enterprise defense. I negotiate for premiums reflecting this strategic pivot and my ability to build the unified data platform that powers autonomous security across all Four Pillars."

The Four Pillars strategy generates enormous data volumes — billions of security events per day across endpoints, networks, clouds, and email. Data Engineers who can build pipelines that process this data in real time for the Agentic AI Stack are uniquely valuable.

#### Global Lever 1: Infinity Platform & Consolidated Security

Data Engineers on Infinity build the cross-pillar data lake and analytics platform that enables unified threat intelligence. Negotiate: "Infinity's consolidated data platform must ingest and unify data from three acquired systems following the February 13, 2026 acquisitions. My experience building enterprise data platforms directly enables the Four Pillars strategy's data foundation."

#### Global Lever 2: CloudGuard & Cloud Security

CloudGuard Data Engineers build pipelines that ingest cloud security telemetry from AWS, Azure, and GCP environments. Leverage: "CloudGuard's AI-driven cloud security — powered by the 3 AI startups acquired Feb 13, 2026 — requires Data Engineers who can build real-time Agentic AI Stack data pipelines for multi-cloud environments under the Four Pillars strategy."

#### Global Lever 3: Harmony & Endpoint/Access Security

Harmony Data Engineers build pipelines for endpoint telemetry, email metadata, and user behavior data at massive scale. State: "Harmony's autonomous endpoint defense following the February 13, 2026 acquisitions needs Data Engineers who can build Agentic AI Stack data pipelines for billions of daily endpoint events within the Four Pillars framework."

#### Global Lever 4: Quantum & Network Security

Quantum Data Engineers build pipelines for network flow data, firewall logs, and IoT telemetry. Negotiate: "Quantum's integration of AI models from the three AI startups acquired February 13, 2026, requires Data Engineers who can build high-throughput Agentic AI Stack data pipelines for network security under the Four Pillars strategy."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy**: Open at $200,000 base with 1,100 RSUs ($220,000 at CHKP ~$200). Accept-at floor: $380,000 total comp. Cite the February 13, 2026 triple AI startup acquisition, the Four Pillars strategy, and your Agentic AI Stack defense expertise.
