**Negotiation DNA**

Software Engineers at Groq are foundational to the company's mission of delivering the fastest AI inference on the planet through its proprietary LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture. With the landmark $20B NVIDIA deal validating Groq's strategic position in the AI inference stack, software engineers working on compiler toolchains, runtime systems, and developer SDKs are directly contributing to the technology that convinced the GPU incumbent to partner rather than compete. This creates significant leverage for candidates entering negotiations, as each engineering hire accelerates Groq's ability to capture market share during the current AI infrastructure buildout.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal is a paradigm-shifting event for Groq's compensation philosophy. NVIDIA — the dominant force in AI compute — chose to license and integrate Groq's LPU inference technology rather than build a competing solution, proving that Groq's architecture occupies a defensible, high-value niche in the AI stack. For Software Engineers, this means your work on compiler optimization, kernel development, and inference runtime directly supports the technology that anchors this deal. The "control-through-licensing" strategy means Groq retains architectural control while NVIDIA distributes — creating massive upside for early employees whose equity is tied to this trajectory.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"I'm excited about Groq's trajectory, especially given the $20B NVIDIA deal that validates the LPU architecture. Given that this deal creates a multi-year revenue runway and positions Groq for a potential IPO in the next 18–36 months, I'd like to discuss a Retention Sign-on — an additional equity grant or cash bonus specifically designed to ensure I'm committed through this hypergrowth phase. Other late-stage AI infrastructure companies like Cerebras and Anyscale are offering $30K–$50K retention sign-ons to secure engineering talent. I'd like to propose a $35K–$45K retention sign-on, vesting over 18 months, to reflect the strategic value of this role during the NVIDIA integration period."*

**Global Levers**

1. **LPU Architecture Scarcity:** "Engineers with low-level systems experience relevant to custom AI inference hardware are exceptionally rare. My background in [compiler optimization/runtime systems/hardware-software co-design] directly maps to Groq's LPU stack, and this talent pool is being actively courted by Cerebras, SambaNova, and NVIDIA itself."
2. **NVIDIA Deal Integration Premium:** "The $20B NVIDIA deal creates urgent integration work that requires experienced engineers immediately. I'd like my offer to reflect the time-sensitivity of ramping up the engineering team to deliver on this partnership."
3. **Pre-IPO Equity Upside:** "At a $14B valuation with the NVIDIA deal providing revenue certainty, Groq's equity has a clearer path to liquidity than most pre-IPO companies. I'd like to negotiate for a larger equity grant with an accelerated vesting schedule to align my incentives with the company's IPO timeline."
4. **Competing Offer Leverage:** "I'm currently evaluating offers from [NVIDIA/Google/Meta/Cerebras] with total compensation packages in the $200K–$240K range. I'm genuinely more excited about Groq's mission and the LPU architecture, but I need the offer to be competitive to make the move from a public company with liquid equity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "Based on my research and competing offers, I'm targeting a total compensation package of $215K–$232K for this Software Engineer role. My base salary ask is $160K–$170K, with an equity grant valued at $45K–$50K annually over four years. I'd also like a $40K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, given the NVIDIA deal integration timeline. My accept-at floor is $195K total comp with at minimum a $25K retention sign-on. If Groq can meet this, I'm prepared to sign this week and decline my competing offers from [Company X] at $210K TC."
