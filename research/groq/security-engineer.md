**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Groq protect the infrastructure, intellectual property, and customer data that underpin the world's fastest AI inference platform. You secure the LPU hardware supply chain, GroqCloud's multi-tenant inference platform, enterprise customer data in transit and at rest, and the proprietary compiler and runtime that deliver Groq's speed advantage. With the $20B NVIDIA deal requiring enterprise-grade security posture and compliance certifications, security engineers are directly enabling Groq's ability to serve NVIDIA's Fortune 500 customer base. A security breach at Groq doesn't just lose data — it destroys the trust that the entire NVIDIA partnership depends on.

**Level Mapping:** Groq Security Engineer ≈ Google Security Engineer L4–L5 · Meta Security Engineer (IC4–IC5) · Amazon Security Engineer SDE-II–III · Apple Security Engineer · NVIDIA Security Engineer · CrowdStrike Senior Engineer

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal requires Groq to meet enterprise-grade security and compliance standards that NVIDIA's customers demand — SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and potentially FedRAMP. Security Engineers are the ones who build and maintain this compliance posture, directly unlocking the enterprise market segments that drive revenue from the partnership. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, Groq's security posture is part of the value proposition — NVIDIA's customers need confidence that LPU-powered inference meets their security requirements. Every compliance certification you achieve opens a new customer segment and accelerates deal velocity.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Security Engineer, I'll be building the compliance and security infrastructure that enables Groq to serve NVIDIA's enterprise customer base under the $20B deal. Security program continuity is critical — mid-stream transitions mean delayed compliance certifications, lost audit context, and potential gaps in coverage. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $38K–$52K, vesting over 18 months. Every compliance certification I achieve — SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA — directly unlocks new enterprise revenue segments. Losing the security engineer who built these programs means re-training, re-auditing, and lost momentum. I've seen similar retention packages for security engineers at Palo Alto Networks ($42K) and CrowdStrike ($48K) during critical growth phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Compliance-as-Revenue-Enabler:** "Every compliance certification I deliver — SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP — unlocks an entirely new customer segment for the NVIDIA partnership. My security work directly enables tens of millions in enterprise revenue that can't flow without these certifications."
2. **AI Infrastructure Security Specialization:** "Securing custom AI silicon platforms is a novel discipline. There's no established playbook for LPU security, multi-tenant inference isolation, or model data protection on custom hardware. I'm inventing the security patterns for a fundamentally new computing paradigm."
3. **IP Protection for Core Technology:** "Groq's LPU design, compiler, and runtime represent billions in R&D investment. I protect the intellectual property that constitutes Groq's entire competitive moat — from supply chain security to insider threat prevention. That existential-risk protection role deserves outsized compensation."
4. **Security Market Competition:** "Security engineers with AI infrastructure experience are commanding $260K–$290K TC at companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Google. Groq's offer needs to be competitive, especially given the novel security challenges of custom silicon."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Security Engineer role, I'm targeting total compensation of $262K–$282K. My base salary ask is $195K–$205K, with annual equity of $50K–$58K over four years. I'd also like a $48K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my role in building the compliance infrastructure that enables the NVIDIA partnership. My accept-at floor is $235K total comp with a minimum $32K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from CrowdStrike at $270K TC and am prepared to prioritize Groq if the package reflects the critical nature of this security role."
