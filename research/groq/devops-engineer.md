**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at Groq build and maintain the infrastructure that keeps the world's fastest AI inference platform running at scale and with reliability. From orchestrating LPU cluster deployments to managing GroqCloud's CI/CD pipelines and monitoring inference serving uptime, DevOps is the operational backbone that ensures Groq's speed advantage reaches customers without interruption. The $20B NVIDIA deal amplifies this role's importance — as NVIDIA's customer base begins consuming LPU-powered inference at scale, the infrastructure must be robust, observable, and auto-scalable.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal means Groq's inference infrastructure must scale to support NVIDIA's massive enterprise customer base. DevOps Engineers are responsible for ensuring that the LPU platform can handle this scaling event — from cluster provisioning and deployment automation to monitoring, alerting, and incident response. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, Groq owns the infrastructure that delivers inference performance, and any downtime or scaling failure directly impacts revenue from the NVIDIA partnership. Your operational expertise is the foundation on which the $20B deal delivers actual value.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a DevOps Engineer, I'll be building the operational foundation that supports Groq's scaling through the $20B NVIDIA deal. The infrastructure patterns, monitoring systems, and deployment pipelines I establish now will determine whether Groq can scale 10x–100x without proportional ops headcount. Given the critical nature of infrastructure reliability during this growth phase, I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $30K–$42K, vesting over 18 months. Losing a DevOps engineer mid-scaling event means lost institutional knowledge about LPU cluster management, deployment patterns, and incident playbooks. I've seen similar retention packages at Datadog ($35K) and HashiCorp ($38K) for infrastructure roles during their high-growth phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Custom Silicon Ops Expertise:** "Managing infrastructure for custom AI silicon — LPU clusters with unique thermal profiles, memory architectures, and interconnect topologies — is fundamentally different from standard cloud DevOps. My expertise in [Kubernetes/infrastructure-as-code/monitoring] applied to custom hardware creates a rare skill set."
2. **Uptime-as-Revenue Linkage:** "For inference-as-a-service, infrastructure uptime directly equals revenue. Every minute of GroqCloud availability I maintain translates to real dollars from the NVIDIA partnership. My on-call responsibilities and reliability engineering directly protect the revenue stream."
3. **Scaling Trajectory Alignment:** "GroqCloud is scaling from early adopters to enterprise-grade deployments driven by the NVIDIA deal. The infrastructure I build now must support 10x–100x growth. That greenfield infrastructure design responsibility deserves premium compensation."
4. **DevOps Market Competition:** "Experienced DevOps/SRE engineers are commanding $230K–$260K TC at companies like Datadog, Cloudflare, and Google. Groq's offer needs to be competitive, especially given the custom silicon complexity of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this DevOps Engineer role, I'm targeting total compensation of $232K–$248K. My base salary ask is $175K–$185K, with annual equity of $42K–$48K over four years. I'd also like a $38K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my critical role in infrastructure scaling for the NVIDIA deal. My accept-at floor is $210K total comp with a minimum $25K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Datadog at $240K TC and am prepared to prioritize Groq if we can align on these numbers."
