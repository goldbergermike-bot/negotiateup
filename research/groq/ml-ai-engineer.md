**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Groq sit at the nexus of machine learning and custom silicon optimization — the exact intersection that defines the company's product-market fit. You optimize ML models to maximize tokens-per-second on the LPU architecture, develop quantization strategies that preserve accuracy while maximizing throughput, and build the inference compiler optimizations that translate arbitrary models into LPU-native instructions. This role carries the +15-25% AI Premium because your work directly determines how fast the LPU processes every model — you're not just using AI infrastructure, you're building the AI inference engine itself. The $20B NVIDIA deal validates that this optimization work has massive commercial value.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal is predicated on the LPU's inference speed advantage, and ML/AI Engineers are the ones who maximize that advantage for every model architecture. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, every inference throughput improvement you achieve compounds across NVIDIA's entire customer base — a 15% improvement in LLM serving throughput means 15% better cost-per-token economics for every NVIDIA customer running on Groq. Your optimizations don't just help one deployment; they improve the fundamental value proposition that NVIDIA is paying $20B to license. This fleet-wide impact creates exceptional leverage for negotiating the AI Premium on top of standard engineering compensation.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As an ML/AI Engineer, I'll be directly optimizing the inference performance that NVIDIA is paying $20B to license. Every throughput improvement I achieve — quantization optimization, compiler kernel tuning, model architecture adaptation — compounds across NVIDIA's entire customer base. The +15-25% AI Premium reflects the specialized nature of this work, and I'd like to complement it with a Retention Sign-on of $50K–$68K, vesting over 24 months. ML/AI engineers with custom silicon optimization experience are the most sought-after talent in the industry — Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and NVIDIA are all actively recruiting this profile. This retention package ensures I'm committed to Groq through the critical NVIDIA integration and pre-IPO window."*

**Global Levers**

1. **AI Premium (15-25%):** "The +15-25% AI Premium is standard for ML/AI engineers at top-tier companies and reflects the specialized nature of inference optimization work. My compensation should start from a premium baseline: standard ML compensation of $200K–$270K TC adjusted upward by 15-25% to $235K–$328K."
2. **LPU-Native ML Expertise Scarcity:** "ML engineers who understand custom AI silicon — not just CUDA, but fundamentally different processor architectures like the LPU — represent perhaps 100–200 people globally. Every month I spend optimizing models for LPU architecture makes me exponentially more valuable and essentially irreplaceable."
3. **Fleet-Wide Optimization Impact:** "Every percentage point of throughput improvement I achieve applies to every inference request across the entire Groq-NVIDIA fleet. A 10% improvement in my model optimization translates to a 10% improvement in cost-per-token economics for every customer. That fleet-wide compounding impact justifies premium equity."
4. **Competing ML Engineer Offers:** "My offers from [Google DeepMind/NVIDIA/Anthropic/Meta FAIR] are in the $310K–$340K TC range with liquid equity. The AI Premium must be reflected in Groq's equity grant to make the illiquidity math work."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this ML/AI Engineer role with the +15-25% AI Premium, I'm targeting total compensation of $310K–$328K. My base salary ask is $225K–$238K, with annual equity of $65K–$72K over four years. I'd also like a $60K retention sign-on vesting over 24 months, reflecting the extreme scarcity of ML engineers with custom silicon experience. My accept-at floor is $275K total comp with a minimum $42K retention sign-on and the AI Premium applied to base salary. I have competing offers from Anthropic at $320K TC and NVIDIA at $310K TC with liquid equity. If Groq can meet this target, I'm prepared to commit and bring my inference optimization expertise to the LPU platform."
