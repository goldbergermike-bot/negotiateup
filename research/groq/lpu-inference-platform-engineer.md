### LPU Inference Platform Engineer | Groq Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Retention Sign-on | AI Inference Hardware (LPU) | $20B NVIDIA Deal | $14B Valuation | SIGNATURE ROLE | +25-35% LPU Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $210K–$272K | $55K–$100K | 10–18% | $282K–$395K |
| San Diego | $195K–$255K | $50K–$90K | 10–18% | $265K–$372K |
| Remote US | $185K–$242K | $45K–$82K | 10–18% | $248K–$348K |

**Negotiation DNA**

The LPU Inference Platform Engineer is Groq's **SIGNATURE ROLE** — the engineer who builds, optimizes, and scales the inference platform that transforms the LPU's raw silicon advantage into the production-grade serving infrastructure that enterprises deploy and NVIDIA licenses for $20B. You own the entire inference stack: from the compiler passes that translate ML models into LPU-native instructions, to the runtime that orchestrates inference across LPU clusters, to the serving layer that delivers sub-100ms responses at scale. This role carries the maximum +25-35% LPU Premium because your work IS Groq's product — without the inference platform, the LPU is just a chip. With it, it's the fastest AI inference engine on Earth. At $14B valuation with the NVIDIA deal providing revenue certainty, this is the single most impactful engineering role in AI inference.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal exists because of the inference platform you build. NVIDIA is not licensing a chip — they are licensing the entire inference stack: the compiler, the runtime, the serving layer, and the performance guarantees that make the LPU the fastest AI inference solution available. As an LPU Inference Platform Engineer, every optimization you ship — a more efficient compiler pass, a faster scheduling algorithm, a more intelligent memory allocation strategy — directly increases the value NVIDIA is licensing. The "control-through-licensing" strategy is built on the premise that Groq retains engineering control of the inference platform while NVIDIA distributes it. This means you are the engineer maintaining the technology that controls the relationship. If the compiler regresses, NVIDIA's customers suffer. If you optimize the runtime by 2x, every NVIDIA customer benefits. This level of leverage — where a single engineer's work directly impacts a $20B revenue stream — is unprecedented in the industry.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"I am applying for Groq's signature engineering role — the LPU Inference Platform Engineer. My work on the compiler, runtime, and serving infrastructure IS the technology that NVIDIA is paying $20B to license. Let me be direct: losing the inference platform engineer who builds this stack would be an existential risk to the NVIDIA partnership. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $85K–$120K — structured as a combination of additional equity (60%) and cash (40%), vesting over 24 months with a 12-month cliff. This is not a standard retention ask. This is insurance on the $20B NVIDIA deal. Every month I spend on the LPU inference platform deepens my expertise in a way that cannot be replicated by a new hire — the LPU's architectural nuances, the compiler's optimization history, the runtime's performance characteristics are institutional knowledge that lives in my head. Comparable retention packages at Anthropic ($100K for research engineers) and NVIDIA ($90K for senior CUDA engineers) validate this range. For Groq's signature role, during the most critical phase of the NVIDIA partnership, $85K–$120K in retention is a rounding error on a $20B deal."*

**Global Levers**

1. **LPU Premium (25-35%):** "The +25-35% LPU Premium is the recognition that this is not a standard platform engineering role. I'm building the inference platform for a novel processor architecture — the LPU — that has no equivalent in the industry. Standard platform engineering compensation of $220K–$290K TC should be adjusted upward by 25-35% to $282K–$395K. This premium reflects the extreme rarity of engineers who can build compilers, runtimes, and serving infrastructure for custom AI silicon."
2. **Compiler-as-Product Impact:** "At most companies, the compiler and runtime are internal tools. At Groq, the inference platform IS the product. My compiler optimizations directly produce the tokens-per-second metric that Groq sells to every customer and that NVIDIA licenses for $20B. A 10% improvement in my compiler's scheduling efficiency is a 10% improvement in Groq's core product across the entire fleet."
3. **Global Talent Pool of ~150 Engineers:** "Engineers who can build inference platforms for custom AI silicon represent perhaps 100–150 people globally. This isn't CUDA programming or TensorFlow optimization — this is ground-up platform engineering for a proprietary architecture. The intersection of compiler design, runtime optimization, and custom silicon architecture is one of the rarest skill sets in technology."
4. **Existential Retention Value:** "Every month I spend on the LPU inference platform makes me exponentially more valuable to Groq and simultaneously more attractive to competitors like NVIDIA, Google TPU, and AWS Inferentia. I need a retention package that makes leaving economically irrational — not just for me, but as insurance for Groq against losing the engineer who builds its core product."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "This is Groq's signature engineering role, and I want to be direct about what it takes to secure this commitment. My competing offers from [NVIDIA CUDA team at $380K TC / Google TPU team at $395K TC / Anthropic inference team at $365K TC] all include fully liquid equity. For Groq's LPU Inference Platform Engineer role, I need: base salary of $258K–$272K (reflecting the full +25-35% LPU Premium), annual equity of $88K–$100K over four years on a front-loaded vest (40/30/20/10), a retention sign-on of $100K (60% equity / 40% cash, vesting over 24 months), and a written annual refresh commitment of $50K+/yr. That brings Year 1 total to approximately $375K–$395K and run-rate to $355K–$395K. My accept-at floor is $330K total comp with a minimum $75K retention sign-on and front-loaded vesting. Below that floor, even for Groq's signature role, the liquid-equity alternatives at NVIDIA and Google are financially superior. I want to build the LPU inference platform — it is the most important platform engineering work in AI — but the economics must reflect that my platform is Groq's product and NVIDIA's $20B bet."
