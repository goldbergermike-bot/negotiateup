**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Groq operate at the intersection of inference performance analytics, customer usage modeling, and hardware-software optimization. With the $20B NVIDIA deal generating massive volumes of inference telemetry, usage data, and performance benchmarks, data scientists play a critical role in understanding how the LPU performs across workloads, identifying optimization opportunities, and building the analytical foundation for pricing and capacity planning. This data-driven approach to hardware platform optimization is central to Groq's competitive strategy and creates strong negotiation positioning.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal creates an explosion of performance data, usage patterns, and inference telemetry that Data Scientists must analyze to optimize the LPU platform. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, Groq needs to demonstrate ongoing performance superiority to justify the licensing premium — and data scientists are the ones who build the benchmarks, analyze workload distributions, and identify optimization targets that prove LPU value. Your analytical work directly informs product roadmap decisions, pricing models, and the performance guarantees embedded in the NVIDIA licensing agreement.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Data Scientist, I'll be building the analytical infrastructure that demonstrates LPU performance advantages and informs pricing decisions for the $20B NVIDIA partnership. The models and benchmarks I create will directly impact how Groq quantifies and communicates its value to NVIDIA's customer base. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $35K–$45K, vesting over 18 months. Data science work is highly context-dependent — the institutional knowledge I build about LPU performance characteristics and workload patterns is not easily transferable. This retention package ensures continuity of analytical expertise during the critical NVIDIA integration phase."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Inference Analytics Expertise:** "Data scientists who understand AI inference performance at the hardware level — latency distributions, throughput modeling, workload characterization — are rare. My background in [performance analytics/systems modeling] directly maps to Groq's needs."
2. **Pricing & Capacity Intelligence:** "The pricing models I build will determine how Groq monetizes the NVIDIA partnership. A 10% improvement in pricing accuracy translates to hundreds of millions in optimized revenue over the life of the deal."
3. **Benchmark & Performance Proof:** "Under the control-through-licensing model, Groq must continuously prove LPU superiority. I'll build the benchmarking frameworks and performance dashboards that validate Groq's value proposition to NVIDIA and its customers."
4. **Data Science Market Rates:** "Data scientists with AI infrastructure experience are commanding $240K–$270K TC at companies like Anthropic, Databricks, and Scale AI. Groq's offer should be competitive with these benchmarks."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Data Scientist role, I'm targeting total compensation of $248K–$265K. My base salary ask is $185K–$195K, with annual equity of $45K–$52K over four years. I'd also like a $40K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, given my role in building the analytical foundation for the NVIDIA partnership. My accept-at floor is $225K total comp with a minimum $28K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Databricks at $255K TC and am prepared to commit to Groq if we can close the gap."
