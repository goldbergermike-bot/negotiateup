**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Software Engineers at Groq set the technical direction for entire subsystems within the LPU inference platform, from compiler architecture to distributed serving infrastructure. At the staff level, engineers are expected to make cross-team architectural decisions that directly impact Groq's ability to deliver on the $20B NVIDIA partnership — whether that's designing the inference API contract, optimizing the compiler pipeline for new model architectures, or defining the performance benchmarks that prove LPU superiority over GPU-based inference. This level of technical authority, combined with the $14B valuation and clear path to IPO, positions staff engineers to negotiate from a place of exceptional strength.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

For Staff Software Engineers, the $20B NVIDIA deal creates a unique leverage multiplier. At this level, you're not just contributing to the technology — you're shaping the architecture that NVIDIA is paying $20B to license. The "control-through-licensing" strategy means that every architectural decision you make directly impacts the value of the licensing agreement. If you design a more efficient compiler pass that improves inference throughput by 2x, that improvement flows through to every NVIDIA customer running Groq-powered inference. This is the kind of outsized impact that justifies premium compensation and aggressive retention packages.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Staff Software Engineer, I'll be making architectural decisions that directly impact the value Groq delivers under the $20B NVIDIA licensing agreement. The technical direction I set will compound over the lifetime of this partnership. Given this level of impact and the critical 18–36 month window before a potential IPO, I'm proposing a Retention Sign-on of $80K–$120K — structured as a combination of additional equity and cash, vesting over 24 months with a 12-month cliff. I've evaluated staff-level retention packages at Databricks ($90K), Anthropic ($100K), and Stripe ($85K), and this range is consistent with what top-tier pre-IPO companies are offering to secure staff-level talent. This investment ensures I'm fully committed through the most critical execution phase of the NVIDIA partnership."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Architectural Authority Premium:** "At the staff level, I'll be making decisions that shape the LPU platform for years to come. These decisions directly impact the value of the NVIDIA licensing deal. I expect my compensation to reflect this level of architectural responsibility."
2. **Public Company Equity Gap:** "I'm currently at [Google/Meta/NVIDIA] with $400K+ in liquid, vested equity. Moving to pre-IPO equity requires a meaningful premium to compensate for illiquidity risk, even with the NVIDIA deal de-risking Groq's trajectory."
3. **Staff-Level Market Competition:** "The market for staff-level systems engineers with inference optimization experience is extraordinarily thin. I'm currently fielding offers from [NVIDIA/Anthropic/Databricks] in the $380K–$430K total comp range, and I need Groq's package to be competitive with these alternatives."
4. **IPO-Aligned Vesting:** "Given Groq's likely IPO timeline of 18–36 months, I'd like to discuss a front-loaded vesting schedule that ensures my largest equity tranches vest during the period of maximum value creation — and maximum share price appreciation."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For the Staff Software Engineer position, I'm targeting total compensation of $400K–$432K. My base salary ask is $275K–$290K, with an annual equity value of $100K–$120K over four years on a front-loaded vest (40/30/20/10). I'm also proposing an $100K retention sign-on with 24-month vesting. My accept-at floor is $355K total comp with a minimum $70K retention sign-on and front-loaded vesting. I have a competing offer from NVIDIA at $410K TC with liquid equity, so Groq's package needs to account for the illiquidity discount while reflecting the upside potential. If we can align, I'm ready to commit."
