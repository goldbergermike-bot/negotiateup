### Product Manager | Groq Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Retention Sign-on | AI Inference Hardware (LPU) | $20B NVIDIA Deal | $14B Valuation | Product Strategy Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $165K–$210K | $35K–$65K | 8–12% | $212K–$292K |
| San Diego | $152K–$195K | $30K–$58K | 8–12% | $195K–$272K |
| Remote US | $145K–$185K | $28K–$52K | 8–12% | $182K–$255K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Groq define the product strategy for the world's fastest AI inference platform, translating the LPU's raw hardware advantage into compelling developer experiences, API products, and enterprise solutions. The $20B NVIDIA deal has transformed Groq from a hardware startup into a platform company, and PMs are responsible for defining the product surfaces that NVIDIA's customers will use to access LPU-powered inference. This strategic product role — sitting at the intersection of hardware capability and market demand — carries significant negotiation leverage.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal creates a unique product management challenge: defining the product interfaces through which NVIDIA's customers access Groq's LPU inference technology. Product Managers will shape the API contracts, pricing models, SLAs, and developer experience that determine how much value Groq captures from this partnership. The "control-through-licensing" strategy means Groq retains product-level control even as NVIDIA handles distribution — every product decision you make directly impacts revenue realization from the $20B deal.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Product Manager, I'll be defining the product surfaces that translate the $20B NVIDIA deal into actual revenue. The API specifications, pricing models, and developer experience I design will determine how effectively Groq monetizes this partnership. Given the critical nature of product decisions during this integration period, I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $40K–$55K, vesting over 18 months. Product strategy continuity is essential — mid-stream PM changes lead to inconsistent product vision and delayed launches. I've seen similar retention packages for PMs at Databricks ($45K) and Snowflake ($50K) during their pre-IPO phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Platform Definition Authority:** "I'll be defining the product strategy for a platform that NVIDIA's customers will use to access LPU inference. These product decisions — API design, pricing, SLAs — directly impact revenue realization from the $20B deal."
2. **AI Product Management Scarcity:** "PMs who understand both AI infrastructure (inference optimization, model serving, hardware constraints) and developer experience are exceptionally rare. My background in [AI/ML platform product management] at [previous company] is directly applicable."
3. **Revenue Impact Correlation:** "Every product decision I make translates into revenue from the NVIDIA partnership. A well-designed API that reduces integration friction by 50% could accelerate deal revenue by months. My compensation should reflect this direct revenue impact."
4. **Competing PM Offers:** "I'm evaluating PM roles at [Anthropic/OpenAI/Databricks] with total compensation in the $270K–$295K range. Groq's package needs to be competitive, accounting for the equity upside from the NVIDIA deal."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Product Manager role, I'm targeting total compensation of $275K–$292K. My base salary ask is $195K–$210K, with annual equity of $55K–$65K over four years. I'd also like a $50K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my critical role in product strategy during the NVIDIA integration. My accept-at floor is $245K total comp with a minimum $35K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Anthropic at $280K TC and am prepared to commit to Groq this week if we can align on these numbers."
