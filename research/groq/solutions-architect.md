**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Groq serve as the technical bridge between the LPU's raw inference speed and enterprise adoption. You design real-time AI architectures for enterprise customers, demonstrate how LPU-powered inference integrates into existing production systems, and build the proof-of-concept deployments that convert technical evaluations into signed contracts. With the $20B NVIDIA deal expanding Groq's enterprise reach through NVIDIA's customer network, solutions architects are at the tip of the enterprise spear — and every deal you support contributes to revenue realization from the partnership.

**Level Mapping:** Groq SA ≈ Google Cloud SA L4–L5 · AWS Sr. Solutions Architect · Azure SA · NVIDIA Solutions Architect · Cerebras SA · Databricks SA

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal creates an enormous influx of enterprise customers who need help integrating LPU-powered inference into their production AI systems. Solutions Architects are the front line of this integration wave — designing architectures, running benchmarks, and proving ROI for each enterprise deployment. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, Groq maintains technical control of the deployment experience even when distributed through NVIDIA, meaning your architectural guidance directly shapes how enterprises perceive and adopt LPU technology. Every successful deployment strengthens the partnership and accelerates revenue realization.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Solutions Architect, I'll be the primary technical relationship holder for enterprise customers adopting Groq's LPU technology through the NVIDIA partnership. Customer relationships and deployment expertise are deeply personal — losing a SA mid-engagement means lost trust, delayed deployments, and potential deal fallout. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $35K–$48K, vesting over 18 months, to ensure continuity of customer relationships and deployment expertise during the critical NVIDIA integration period. I've seen similar retention packages for SAs at Snowflake ($40K) and Databricks ($45K) during their scaling phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Revenue Attribution:** "Every enterprise deployment I support directly contributes to Groq's revenue from the NVIDIA partnership. My architectural designs and POC deliveries convert technical evaluations into production deployments. That revenue-generating technical selling deserves variable compensation on top of base and equity."
2. **LPU Deployment Expertise Scarcity:** "There are zero experienced LPU deployment architects outside of Groq. Every month I spend learning LPU architecture patterns, integration challenges, and enterprise deployment workflows makes me exponentially more valuable and essentially irreplaceable."
3. **Customer-Facing Technical Authority:** "I represent Groq's technical capability to its most important enterprise customers. My credibility and communication skills directly influence whether enterprises commit multi-year contracts through the NVIDIA channel."
4. **SA Market Benchmarks:** "Solutions architects at Google Cloud, AWS, and Databricks are commanding $245K–$275K TC with liquid equity plus variable. Groq's package needs to be competitive, especially given the customer-facing scope of this role."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Solutions Architect role, I'm targeting total compensation of $248K–$265K. My base salary ask is $185K–$195K, with annual equity of $45K–$52K over four years. I'd also like a $42K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my role as the technical face of the NVIDIA partnership to enterprise customers. My accept-at floor is $225K total comp with a minimum $30K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Databricks at $258K TC with liquid equity and am prepared to commit to Groq if we can close the gap."
