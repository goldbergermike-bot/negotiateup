**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Groq lead the teams building the world's fastest AI inference platform, directly translating the LPU architectural vision into production-ready systems. With the $20B NVIDIA deal requiring coordinated execution across compiler, runtime, API, and infrastructure teams, engineering managers are the critical connective tissue ensuring Groq delivers on its most important partnership. The ability to recruit, retain, and ship with top-tier systems engineers makes this role essential to Groq's hypergrowth trajectory and positions managers to negotiate aggressively on both base compensation and equity.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

Engineering Managers at Groq sit at the intersection of technical execution and strategic delivery for the $20B NVIDIA deal. The "control-through-licensing" model requires tight coordination between Groq's engineering teams and NVIDIA's integration requirements — and that coordination is the engineering manager's domain. You'll be responsible for ensuring your team delivers the performance milestones, API specifications, and integration deliverables that keep the NVIDIA partnership on track. This direct line between your team's output and a $20B revenue commitment gives you extraordinary leverage in compensation negotiations.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As an Engineering Manager, I'll be responsible for building and retaining the team that delivers on the $20B NVIDIA partnership. My ability to recruit top engineers, set technical direction, and hit integration milestones directly impacts the success of Groq's most important revenue relationship. I'd like to discuss a Retention Sign-on of $60K–$80K, vesting over 24 months, to ensure continuity of leadership through the NVIDIA integration phase. Losing a manager mid-integration would create significant disruption to delivery timelines, and this retention package is an insurance policy against that risk. I've seen similar packages at Anthropic and Databricks for engineering management roles."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Team-Building Leverage:** "Building a world-class inference engineering team during AI's biggest talent war requires an experienced manager who can close senior candidates. My track record of hiring [X] senior engineers at [previous company] demonstrates I can build the team Groq needs to deliver on the NVIDIA timeline."
2. **NVIDIA Delivery Accountability:** "The $20B NVIDIA deal comes with delivery milestones. As EM, I'll be directly accountable for whether my team hits those milestones. That accountability should be reflected in my compensation and equity structure."
3. **Retention Multiplier Effect:** "When an engineering manager leaves, teams fragment. At a critical juncture like the NVIDIA integration, manager turnover doesn't just lose one person — it risks losing the 8–12 engineers on the team. My retention sign-on is an investment in team stability."
4. **Management Market Dynamics:** "Engineering managers with AI infrastructure experience and a track record of shipping low-latency systems are among the hardest roles to fill. I'm evaluating opportunities at [Anthropic/Databricks/Google DeepMind] with packages in the $340K–$380K range."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Engineering Manager role, I'm targeting total compensation of $350K–$372K. My base salary ask is $240K–$255K, with annual equity of $75K–$90K over four years. I'd like a $70K retention sign-on vesting over 24 months to align with the NVIDIA integration timeline. My accept-at floor is $305K total comp with a minimum $50K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Anthropic at $360K TC and am willing to prioritize Groq if the package is competitive, given my deep conviction in the LPU architecture."
