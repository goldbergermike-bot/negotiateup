### Technical Program Manager | Groq Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Pre-IPO Equity + Base + Retention Sign-on | AI Inference Hardware (LPU) | $20B NVIDIA Deal | $14B Valuation | Cross-Functional Execution Premium

| Region | Base Salary | Equity (Options/RSU est.) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|------------|
| Mountain View | $145K–$182K | $25K–$48K | 5–12% | $178K–$248K |
| San Diego | $134K–$168K | $22K–$43K | 5–12% | $165K–$230K |
| Remote US | $126K–$160K | $20K–$38K | 5–12% | $152K–$215K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Groq orchestrate the most complex programs in AI hardware — from LPU chip development timelines and compiler release schedules to GroqCloud platform launches and the massive integration workstreams required by the $20B NVIDIA deal. You're the connective tissue that ensures cross-functional teams ship on time and in coordination, directly impacting whether Groq hits the milestones that justify its $14B valuation and drive toward IPO readiness. The NVIDIA deal adds an external partnership dimension that makes program management at Groq uniquely challenging and valuable.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal introduces a massive external coordination requirement that sits squarely on the TPM's shoulders. Managing the integration timeline between Groq's engineering teams and NVIDIA's technical requirements — while simultaneously coordinating internal chip development, compiler releases, and platform launches — is a multi-dimensional program management challenge. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, Groq must deliver on specific performance milestones and integration deadlines to maintain the partnership. The TPM is accountable for ensuring these milestones are tracked, communicated, and met.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Technical Program Manager, I'll be orchestrating the integration workstreams between Groq and NVIDIA — coordinating across chip development, compiler, runtime, platform, and partnership teams to deliver on the $20B deal's milestones. Program management continuity is critical during complex integrations — a TPM transition mid-program means lost context, re-established relationships, and delayed timelines. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $30K–$42K, vesting over 18 months, to ensure I'm fully committed through the critical NVIDIA integration milestones. I've seen similar retention packages for TPMs at Anthropic ($35K) and Databricks ($40K) during their high-growth phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **NVIDIA Partnership Coordination:** "Managing the integration between Groq and NVIDIA requires a TPM who can navigate both internal cross-functional complexity and external partnership dynamics. My experience coordinating [hardware-software/multi-company] programs directly maps to this challenge."
2. **Hardware-Software Program Complexity:** "Programs that span custom silicon, compiler development, cloud platform launches, and external partnerships are exponentially more complex than pure software TPM work. That complexity premium should be reflected in my compensation."
3. **Milestone-Driven Valuation Impact:** "Every major program milestone I deliver — chip tapeout, compiler release, NVIDIA integration checkpoint, GroqCloud feature launch — directly impacts Groq's valuation trajectory and IPO readiness. My program execution is literally tied to the events that determine equity value."
4. **TPM Market Competition:** "Experienced TPMs with AI hardware and cross-company partnership experience are commanding $230K–$255K TC at Google, Apple, and Anthropic. Groq's offer should be competitive given the program complexity."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Technical Program Manager role, I'm targeting total compensation of $232K–$248K. My base salary ask is $172K–$182K, with annual equity of $42K–$48K over four years. I'd also like a $38K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my role in coordinating the NVIDIA integration program. My accept-at floor is $210K total comp with a minimum $25K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Google at $240K TC and am prepared to commit to Groq if the package reflects the cross-functional complexity of this role."
