**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Groq shape the developer experience and enterprise interfaces for the world's fastest AI inference platform. As Groq transitions from a hardware-first company to a developer platform — accelerated by the $20B NVIDIA deal — design plays an outsized role in ensuring that LPU-powered inference is accessible, intuitive, and differentiated from GPU-based alternatives. Designers who can translate complex technical capabilities into elegant developer tools and dashboards are rare in the AI infrastructure space, creating meaningful negotiation leverage.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal means that Groq's developer tools, dashboards, and API documentation will be used by a massive number of NVIDIA's enterprise customers. Product Designers are responsible for crafting the experience layer that makes LPU inference not just faster, but easier to adopt than GPU alternatives. The "control-through-licensing" strategy means Groq owns the product experience even when distributed through NVIDIA — your design decisions directly impact developer adoption rates and, consequently, the commercial success of the partnership.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"The $20B NVIDIA deal means that the developer experience I design will be the interface through which thousands of enterprise customers interact with Groq's LPU technology. Design consistency and vision continuity are critical during this integration phase — a designer transition mid-project would mean lost context and inconsistent user experiences. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $25K–$35K, vesting over 18 months, to ensure I'm fully committed through the initial NVIDIA integration launches. Companies like Figma and Canva have offered similar retention packages to designers during critical growth phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Developer Experience Differentiation:** "In AI infrastructure, the developer experience is a competitive moat. My design work will determine whether developers choose Groq's APIs over competitors — directly impacting the success of the NVIDIA partnership."
2. **AI/ML Design Specialization:** "Designers who understand AI infrastructure, model serving concepts, and developer tooling are exceptionally rare. My portfolio includes [relevant AI/developer tool design work], which directly translates to Groq's design challenges."
3. **Enterprise Design Complexity:** "Designing for NVIDIA's enterprise customers requires understanding complex technical workflows. My experience designing enterprise developer platforms at [previous company] means I can deliver production-quality designs faster."
4. **Design Market Positioning:** "I'm evaluating design roles at [Figma/Vercel/Anthropic] with packages ranging from $185K–$220K TC. While Groq's equity upside is compelling, the cash portion needs to be competitive."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Product Designer role, I'm targeting total compensation of $200K–$218K. My base salary ask is $152K–$162K, with annual equity of $35K–$40K over four years. I'd also like a $30K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my role in designing the developer experience for the NVIDIA integration. My accept-at floor is $180K total comp with a minimum $20K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Vercel at $205K TC and am willing to prioritize Groq if the total package is within range."
