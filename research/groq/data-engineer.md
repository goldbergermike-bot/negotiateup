**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Groq build the data infrastructure that makes the world's fastest AI inference platform measurable, observable, and optimizable. You architect inference data pipelines that capture every token generated, every latency measurement, and every model serving metric — at the throughput of hundreds of tokens per second across a growing fleet of LPU chips. Your pipelines power the performance analytics, model serving telemetry, billing systems, and usage dashboards that both internal teams and enterprise customers depend on. With the $20B NVIDIA deal scaling usage volumes dramatically, data infrastructure is a critical bottleneck that must be solved proactively.

**$20B NVIDIA Deal — The Control-through-Licensing Premium**

The $20B NVIDIA deal generates massive volumes of inference telemetry, usage data, and billing events that Data Engineers must capture, process, and surface reliably. Under the "control-through-licensing" model, Groq must provide NVIDIA and its customers with accurate performance metrics, usage reports, and billing data — all of which flow through the data pipelines you build. Your data infrastructure is the measurement layer that proves the LPU's value, tracks revenue attribution, and enables the pricing intelligence that maximizes Groq's share of the deal.

**Retention Sign-on Script:** *"As a Data Engineer, I'll be building the data pipelines and telemetry infrastructure that supports the $20B NVIDIA partnership — from inference performance monitoring to usage billing to customer-facing analytics dashboards. Data engineering work is deeply context-dependent — the schema designs, pipeline architectures, and data models I build become institutional knowledge that's costly to replicate. I'd like to propose a Retention Sign-on of $30K–$42K, vesting over 18 months. Losing a data engineer mid-migration or mid-pipeline-build means months of re-work and lost data context. I've seen similar retention packages for data engineers at Snowflake ($35K) and Databricks ($40K) during their high-growth phases."*

**Global Levers**

1. **Inference Telemetry at Scale:** "Building data pipelines for real-time AI inference is fundamentally different from standard data engineering. I'm processing millions of inference events per second, each with sub-millisecond timing requirements, across a custom hardware fleet. That technical complexity deserves premium compensation."
2. **Billing Infrastructure as Revenue Enabler:** "My data pipelines power GroqCloud's usage metering and billing systems for the NVIDIA partnership. Accurate, real-time billing infrastructure directly enables Groq's revenue model. That revenue-critical data work commands premium compensation."
3. **Observability Foundation:** "Every optimization the engineering team makes is informed by the performance data I collect and surface. Without my telemetry pipelines, the engineering team flies blind. That enabling-infrastructure role has outsized organizational impact."
4. **Data Engineering Market Rates:** "Data engineers at Databricks, Snowflake, and Google are commanding $235K–$260K TC with liquid equity. Groq's offer should be competitive given the custom infrastructure challenges."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "For this Data Engineer role, I'm targeting total compensation of $235K–$252K. My base salary ask is $175K–$185K, with annual equity of $42K–$50K over four years. I'd also like a $38K retention sign-on vesting over 18 months, reflecting my role in building the data infrastructure for the NVIDIA partnership. My accept-at floor is $212K total comp with a minimum $25K retention sign-on. I have a competing offer from Databricks at $245K TC and am prepared to commit to Groq if we can align on these numbers."
