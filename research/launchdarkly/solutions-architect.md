| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at LaunchDarkly help enterprise customers deploy and optimize feature management across their engineering organizations. SAs design feature flag architectures, configure experimentation frameworks, and help teams adopt progressive delivery practices. Each successful enterprise deployment drives multi-year ARR and expands feature management adoption across the customer's engineering org. [Source: LaunchDarkly SA Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Senior SA = GitLab SA = Optimizely SA = Datadog SA

**Global Levers**

1. **Enterprise Adoption Expansion:** "I help enterprise customers expand feature management from one team to the entire engineering organization. Each expansion drives ARR growth."
2. **Progressive Delivery Expertise:** "I architect progressive delivery workflows — canary deployments, percentage rollouts, and experimentation-driven releases — that transform how customers ship software."
3. **Category Education:** "As the category leader, I'm also educating customers about feature management best practices. I'm building the playbook for the entire market."
4. **GitLab/Datadog SA Counter:** Both pay SAs competitively with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $170K over 4 years. My enterprise deployments expand feature management adoption and drive ARR growth." Counter at $140K-$160K equity is competitive.
