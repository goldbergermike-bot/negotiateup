### Data Scientist | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | Category Creator | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $155K–$220K | $60K–$200K | — | $190K–$320K |
| Remote US | $140K–$205K | $50K–$180K | — | $170K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at LaunchDarkly build the statistical models that power the experimentation platform and AI-driven feature targeting. The experimentation platform requires rigorous statistical methodology — A/B testing, multivariate experiments, sequential testing, and causal inference. DS roles also include building ML models for anomaly detection (detecting feature flag-induced incidents) and automated targeting (ML-driven audience segmentation for feature rollouts).

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Senior DS = Optimizely DS = Google L4 DS = Datadog DS

**Global Levers**

1. **Experimentation Statistics:** "I'm building the statistical engine that powers A/B testing and experimentation for enterprise customers. This requires deep expertise in sequential testing, causal inference, and multivariate analysis."
2. **Anomaly Detection:** "My ML models detect feature-flag-induced incidents in real-time, enabling automated rollbacks that prevent customer-facing outages."
3. **AI-Driven Targeting:** If building ML-driven audience targeting, push for AI premium: "I'm building ML models that optimize feature rollout targeting — a novel ML application."
4. **Google/Meta DS Counter:** Both offer higher DS comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years. I'm building the statistical experimentation engine and anomaly detection ML models for the category-leading platform." Counter at $160K-$180K equity is competitive.
