### Senior Software Engineer | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | Category Creator | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $170K–$225K | $80K–$220K | — | $215K–$340K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Senior SWEs at LaunchDarkly own major subsystems of the feature management platform — the flag evaluation engine, SDK ecosystem, experimentation framework, or infrastructure layer. At LaunchDarkly's company size, senior engineers have significant architectural influence. The platform's sub-millisecond latency requirement and billions of daily evaluations create demanding performance engineering challenges. Private equity requires aggressive negotiation with liquidity protections. [Source: LaunchDarkly Senior SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Senior SWE = GitLab Senior SWE = Google L4 = Optimizely Senior SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Sub-Millisecond Architecture:** "I architect systems that must evaluate feature flags in sub-millisecond time at billions-per-day scale. This performance engineering expertise is rare."
2. **SDK Ecosystem Ownership:** If owning the SDK ecosystem (25+ languages), push for premium: "I maintain SDKs across 25+ languages and frameworks. Each SDK quality issue impacts every LaunchDarkly customer."
3. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium over liquid alternatives for the illiquidity risk."
4. **GitLab/Datadog Counter:** Both offer competitive senior-level comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $210K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm owning core platform subsystems with sub-millisecond latency requirements at billions-per-day scale." Counter at $175K-$200K equity is strong.
