**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at LaunchDarkly build the data infrastructure that processes billions of feature flag evaluations, experimentation results, and platform analytics. The data engineering challenge is exceptional: processing real-time event streams at massive scale with sub-second analytics requirements. Feature flag evaluation data feeds the experimentation platform, enabling customers to measure the impact of feature releases with statistical rigor. [Source: LaunchDarkly DE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Senior DE = GitLab DE = Google L4 DE = Datadog DE

**Global Levers**

1. **Real-Time Event Processing Scale:** "I'm processing billions of real-time feature flag events daily. This event-streaming scale is comparable to the largest data engineering challenges in tech."
2. **Experimentation Data Pipeline:** "My data pipelines feed the experimentation platform — enabling customers to measure feature impact with statistical rigor."
3. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium over liquid alternatives for illiquidity risk."
4. **Snowflake/Databricks DE Counter:** Both pay higher with liquid equity for DE roles.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $185K over 4 years. I'm processing billions of real-time events daily and powering the experimentation platform." Counter at $155K-$175K equity is competitive.
