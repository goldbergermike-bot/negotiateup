| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

DevOps Engineers at LaunchDarkly manage the infrastructure for a platform that processes billions of feature flag evaluations daily with sub-millisecond latency. The platform is globally distributed and must maintain near-perfect uptime — because LaunchDarkly sits in the critical path of customer applications, an outage can cause cascading failures across thousands of companies. This is among the highest-reliability infrastructure challenges in the developer tools space. [Source: LaunchDarkly DevOps Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Senior DevOps = GitLab DevOps = Google L4 SRE = Datadog DevOps

**Global Levers**

1. **Critical-Path Infrastructure:** "LaunchDarkly sits in the critical path of customer applications. An infrastructure outage doesn't just affect LaunchDarkly — it cascades across thousands of customer applications. The reliability standard is exceptional."
2. **Sub-Millisecond Global Distribution:** "Maintaining sub-millisecond flag evaluation latency across a globally distributed infrastructure is a rare infrastructure challenge."
3. **Meta-DevOps Frame:** "I'm managing infrastructure for a feature management platform that other DevOps teams rely on for their own deployments."
4. **Datadog/HashiCorp Counter:** Both offer competitive infrastructure comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $175K over 4 years with acceleration. LaunchDarkly sits in the critical path of thousands of applications, making our infrastructure reliability existentially important." Counter at $145K-$165K equity is competitive.
