### Staff Software Engineer | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | Category Creator | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $200K–$250K | $140K–$320K | — | $290K–$430K |
| Remote US | $185K–$235K | $120K–$290K | — | $265K–$400K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Staff Engineers at LaunchDarkly are the technical architects defining the platform's future. At a $3B private company, Staff Engineers function as domain-level CTOs. The platform's real-time, globally-distributed architecture (sub-millisecond flag evaluation at billions-per-day scale) creates unique technical leadership challenges. Staff Engineers should negotiate for advisory-level equity terms given the illiquidity risk at this comp level. [Source: LaunchDarkly Staff SWE Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Staff SWE = GitLab Staff SWE = Google L5 = Datadog Staff SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Domain CTO Scope:** "At LaunchDarkly's scale, I'm the technical leader for an entire platform domain. My architectural decisions shape the category."
2. **Exit Valuation Impact:** "My architectural decisions directly impact LaunchDarkly's exit valuation. Platform scalability, reliability, and performance determine enterprise deal sizes."
3. **Advisory-Level Equity Terms:** "At Staff level with significant illiquidity risk, I need advisory-level terms: 1-year exercise window, double-trigger acceleration, and a larger grant."
4. **Google/Datadog Staff Counter:** Both offer liquid equity at Staff level. Push LaunchDarkly equity higher.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $415K total comp with equity at $300K over 4 years, advisory terms, and acceleration. My architecture defines the category-leading feature management platform." Counter at $260K-$285K equity with acceleration is competitive.
