### Product Designer | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | Category Creator | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |

**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at LaunchDarkly design the UX for a developer-facing feature management platform. The design challenge is making complex concepts (progressive delivery, feature targeting, experimentation analysis) accessible to engineering teams. LaunchDarkly's UX must serve both individual developers and enterprise platform teams managing thousands of feature flags. [Source: LaunchDarkly Design Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Senior Designer = GitLab Senior Designer = Optimizely Senior Designer

**Global Levers**

1. **Developer UX Complexity:** "Designing feature management UX requires deep understanding of software delivery workflows, targeting rules, and experimentation statistics."
2. **Category-Defining Design:** "LaunchDarkly created this category. My designs define the UX patterns for feature management."
3. **Enterprise + Developer Dual Audience:** "I design for both individual developers and enterprise platform teams — two very different audiences in one product."
4. **Figma/GitLab Counter:** Both offer competitive design comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $160K over 4 years. My designs define the UX for the category-leading feature management platform." Counter at $130K-$150K equity is competitive.
