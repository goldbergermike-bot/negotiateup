### Product Manager | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | Category Creator | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $160K–$220K | $65K–$200K | — | $195K–$320K |
| Remote US | $145K–$205K | $55K–$180K | — | $175K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

PMs at LaunchDarkly own the product roadmap for the category-defining feature management platform. PM scope includes the core flag management experience, experimentation platform, SDK ecosystem, enterprise governance features, and AI capabilities. As category creator, PM decisions at LaunchDarkly define the market — competitors follow LaunchDarkly's product direction. [Source: LaunchDarkly PM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly PM = GitLab PM = Google L5 PM = Optimizely PM

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Defining Product Leadership:** "LaunchDarkly created this category. My product decisions don't just serve customers — they define the market standard."
2. **Platform Expansion Strategy:** If driving platform expansion (experimentation, observability), push for premium: "I'm expanding LaunchDarkly's product scope beyond feature flags into adjacent markets."
3. **Enterprise Revenue Ownership:** "My product decisions directly impact enterprise deal sizes and retention."
4. **GitLab/Datadog PM Counter:** Both offer competitive PM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $190K over 4 years. My product decisions define the feature management category, and I have PM offers with liquid equity." Counter at $160K-$180K equity is competitive.
