| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $195K–$250K | $110K–$280K | — | $265K–$410K |

**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at LaunchDarkly lead teams building the category-defining feature management platform. At LaunchDarkly's scale, each EM manages a team whose work directly shapes the product. The platform's real-time, critical-path nature means engineering teams must maintain exceptional reliability while shipping new features. No standard cash bonus means equity is the primary variable lever. [Source: LaunchDarkly EM Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly EM = GitLab EM = Google L5 Manager = Datadog EM

**Global Levers**

1. **Category Creator Leadership:** "I'm managing teams building the platform that created the feature management category. Each team's output defines the market."
2. **Critical-Path Reliability Mandate:** "My teams build infrastructure that sits in the critical path of thousands of applications. The reliability and performance bar is exceptionally high."
3. **IC Parity:** Staff ICs at LaunchDarkly can earn $290K+ in equity. EMs must match.
4. **GitLab/Datadog EM Counter:** Both offer competitive EM comp with liquid equity.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $270K over 4 years with acceleration. I'm leading teams building critical-path infrastructure, and I need comp that exceeds my Staff ICs." Counter at $225K-$255K equity with acceleration is competitive.
