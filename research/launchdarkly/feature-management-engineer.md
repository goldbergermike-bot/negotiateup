### Feature Management Engineer | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | **SIGNATURE ROLE** | Category Creator

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $160K–$220K | $65K–$200K | — | $195K–$320K |
| Remote US | $145K–$205K | $55K–$180K | — | $175K–$295K |

**Negotiation DNA**

This is LaunchDarkly's signature engineering role. Feature Management Engineers build the core feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables progressive delivery, A/B testing, and controlled feature rollouts for enterprise software teams. LaunchDarkly is private ($3B valuation) and headquartered in Oakland, CA. The company created the feature management category — there was no "feature flagging platform" market before LaunchDarkly. The platform processes billions of feature flag evaluations per day with sub-millisecond latency requirements. Private equity creates liquidity risk but the strong market position provides acquisition or IPO potential. [Source: LaunchDarkly Feature Management Eng Comp 2025-2026]

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly Feature Mgmt Eng (Senior) = GitLab Senior SWE = Google L4 = Optimizely Senior SWE

**What Makes This Role Unique**

The Feature Management Engineer works across LaunchDarkly's core platform:
- **Feature Flag Evaluation Engine:** Processing billions of flag evaluations per day with sub-millisecond latency
- **Experimentation Platform:** A/B testing and multivariate experiments integrated with feature flags
- **Progressive Delivery:** Canary deployments, percentage rollouts, and targeted releases
- **SDK Ecosystem:** Client and server SDKs across 25+ languages and frameworks
- **AI-Powered Features:** ML-driven flag targeting, anomaly detection, and automated rollback

**Global Levers**

1. **Category Creator Premium:** "LaunchDarkly created the feature management category. I'm building the platform that defined this market — not a fast-follower."
2. **Billions of Evaluations:** "The platform processes billions of feature flag evaluations per day with sub-millisecond latency. This real-time, mission-critical infrastructure engineering is exceptionally demanding."
3. **Private Equity Upside:** "LaunchDarkly at $3B with category leadership has strong IPO or acquisition potential. I need a larger equity grant to compensate for illiquidity while capturing upside."
4. **GitLab/GitHub Counter:** Both compete for developer platform talent: "GitLab offers public RSUs and GitHub offers Microsoft RSUs. LaunchDarkly's private equity needs to be meaningfully larger."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'm targeting $310K total comp with equity at $190K over 4 years and acceleration on change of control. I'm building the category-defining feature management platform, processing billions of evaluations daily. I have offers from GitLab and GitHub with liquid equity." Counter at $160K-$180K equity with acceleration is competitive.
