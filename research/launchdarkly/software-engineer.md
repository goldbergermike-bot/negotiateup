### Software Engineer | LaunchDarkly Global Negotiation Guide

**Negotiation DNA:** Private ($3B Valuation) | Feature Management Platform | Category Creator | Liquidity Risk

| Region | Base Salary | Stock (Equity/4yr) | Bonus | Total Comp |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Oakland HQ | $145K–$200K | $50K–$180K | — | $175K–$290K |
| Remote US | $130K–$185K | $40K–$160K | — | $155K–$265K |

**Negotiation DNA**

LaunchDarkly is a private feature management platform ($3B valuation) headquartered in Oakland, CA. SWEs build the platform that enables progressive delivery, feature flagging, and experimentation for enterprise customers. The platform must handle billions of feature flag evaluations daily with sub-millisecond latency — making reliability and performance paramount. Private equity creates liquidity risk, but LaunchDarkly's category leadership provides strong exit potential. Compensation is base + equity (no standard cash bonus).

**Level Mapping:** LaunchDarkly SWE = GitLab SWE = Google L3 = Optimizely SWE

**Global Levers**

1. **Category-Leading Platform:** "LaunchDarkly created the feature management category. I'm building the platform that defines this space."
2. **Real-Time Infrastructure Scale:** "Processing billions of feature flag evaluations with sub-millisecond latency is mission-critical infrastructure engineering."
3. **Private Equity Premium:** "I need a 30-40% equity premium over liquid alternatives. GitLab offers public RSUs and GitHub offers Microsoft RSUs."
4. **Acceleration Protection:** Push for double-trigger acceleration and extended exercise windows.

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** "I'd like equity at $170K over 4 years with double-trigger acceleration. I'm building mission-critical infrastructure at the category-leading feature management platform." Counter at $135K-$160K equity with acceleration is competitive.
