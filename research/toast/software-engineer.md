**Negotiation DNA**

Toast has evolved from a restaurant POS terminal company into a full-stack restaurant operating system powering over 120,000 locations nationwide. As a Software Engineer, you are building the foundational infrastructure that processes billions of dollars in payments, orchestrates kitchen operations, and now — with the launch of Toast IQ — delivers AI-powered intelligence that transforms raw transaction data into actionable restaurant insights. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has dramatically expanded the engineering surface area, requiring engineers who can build seamless integrations between Toast's restaurant OS and Instacart's delivery logistics at scale.

The company's trajectory from $4B+ revenue toward becoming the definitive Hospitality Intelligence platform means software engineers are not writing commodity CRUD applications. Every engineer touches real-time payment processing, merchant-facing dashboards, or the growing Toast IQ analytics engine. The shift from a payments company to a restaurant operating system — and now to an intelligence platform — creates exceptional leverage for candidates who understand distributed systems, real-time data pipelines, or consumer-facing product development. Toast's $20B+ market cap reflects Wall Street's confidence in this transformation, and your RSU grants carry meaningful upside as the Hospitality Intelligence strategy matures.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Integration Complexity:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership means Toast engineers are now building real-time integrations between two billion-dollar platforms. I bring experience in distributed systems and API design at scale — the exact skills needed to make this partnership technically seamless across 120,000+ restaurant locations. This integration complexity justifies a base salary at the top of your band."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Data Pipeline Foundation:** "Toast IQ's AI-powered restaurant intelligence depends on robust data pipelines that I would be building from day one. The Hospitality Intelligence platform is Toast's primary growth lever, and every engineer contributing to this system is directly tied to revenue expansion. I'm asking for an additional $15,000-$20,000 in RSUs to reflect my direct contribution to this strategic initiative."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Full-Stack Ownership:** "Toast is no longer just a POS company — it's a restaurant operating system processing billions in payments across 120,000+ locations. Engineers at this level own entire vertical slices of the platform, from payment processing to kitchen display systems. My full-stack experience maps directly to Toast's architecture, and I'd like the compensation to reflect this breadth of ownership."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Market Timing:** "Toast is at an inflection point — the Hospitality Intelligence positioning, the Instacart partnership, and Toast IQ all signal that this is the most valuable time to join. RSU grants today capture the upside of a $20B+ company that Wall Street expects to grow significantly as the restaurant OS strategy plays out. I'd like to see the equity component reflect the growth trajectory from here."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Target the 70th percentile of each range. Push base salary by $10,000-$15,000 above initial offer, and request a 20-25% increase on RSU grants by anchoring to Toast IQ's strategic importance. For a Boston-based role, aim for $155,000 base + $80,000 RSU/4yr + $18,000 bonus = $208,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $145,000 base with $65,000 RSUs in Boston; $155,000 base with $75,000 RSUs in New York; $165,000 base with $85,000 RSUs in San Francisco. Always negotiate RSUs first — Toast's growth trajectory makes equity the highest-leverage component.
