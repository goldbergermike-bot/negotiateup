**Negotiation DNA**

Solutions Architects at Toast serve as the technical bridge between the company's restaurant operating system and the enterprise restaurant groups, multi-unit operators, and strategic partners that represent Toast's highest-value customer segments. With 120,000+ restaurant locations on the platform, the complexity of deployments ranges from single-location independents to thousand-unit chains — and solutions architects design the technical architecture for the largest, most complex implementations. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has created an entirely new category of solutions architecture work: designing how major restaurant groups integrate Toast's in-restaurant OS with Instacart's delivery infrastructure across hundreds or thousands of locations simultaneously.

Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence platform — adds another strategic dimension. Solutions architects must now guide enterprise customers through the deployment and customization of Toast IQ's analytics capabilities, helping multi-unit operators configure demand forecasting, cross-location benchmarking, and AI-driven operational recommendations. This consultative, high-touch technical work directly impacts customer retention and expansion revenue — the metrics that drive Toast's $4B+ revenue trajectory. Solutions architects who understand both the technical platform and the operational realities of restaurant management carry exceptional negotiation leverage, particularly as the Hospitality Intelligence strategy pushes Toast deeper into the enterprise segment.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Enterprise Deployment:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership means enterprise restaurant groups need solutions architects who can design and deploy the integrated Toast-Instacart experience across hundreds of locations simultaneously. I've managed comparable multi-platform enterprise deployments at [previous company], and the complexity of this integration across 120,000+ restaurant locations requires specialized architectural expertise. This justifies a base salary at the top of the SA band — $205,000 in Boston."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Enterprise Enablement:** "Toast IQ's Hospitality Intelligence platform is Toast's primary expansion revenue driver for enterprise accounts. Solutions architects who can design custom Toast IQ deployments — configuring AI-driven analytics, demand forecasting, and cross-location intelligence for multi-unit operators — directly impact customer lifetime value. I bring experience deploying AI/analytics platforms for enterprise customers, and I'm requesting $140,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect this revenue-generating capability."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Technical Authority:** "Toast's restaurant operating system serves 120,000+ locations with diverse hardware configurations, integration requirements, and operational workflows. Solutions architects must understand the entire platform — payments, kitchen operations, workforce management, and now intelligence — to design architectures that work for complex enterprise deployments. My breadth of platform knowledge across [relevant technologies] means I can handle the most complex deals from day one. I'd like a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus to reflect this immediate revenue-contributing capability."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Consultative Premium:** "The Hospitality Intelligence positioning elevates the solutions architect role from technical deployment to strategic consulting. Enterprise customers are buying a vision of AI-powered restaurant operations, and the SA must translate that vision into technical reality. This consultative expertise is scarce — I'm evaluating offers from [competitors] in the $280,000-$340,000 total comp range. I'd like Toast's equity component to close the gap, particularly given the enterprise revenue expansion that Toast IQ enables."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 75th percentile and tie compensation to enterprise revenue impact. Push base salary by $12,000-$18,000 and RSU grants by 25% above initial offer. For Boston, target $200,000 base + $135,000 RSU/4yr + $35,000 bonus = $274,000 total comp. For New York, target $215,000 base + $155,000 RSU/4yr + $40,000 bonus = $299,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $180,000 base with $110,000 RSUs in Boston; $190,000 base with $125,000 RSUs in New York; $200,000 base with $140,000 RSUs in San Francisco. Solutions architects should quantify past enterprise deal sizes and deployment scale — large-deal experience (>$1M ACV) creates maximum leverage in negotiation.
