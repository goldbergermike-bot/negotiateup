**Negotiation DNA**

Product Managers at Toast define the roadmap for the restaurant industry's most comprehensive operating system. With 120,000+ restaurant locations relying on Toast for everything from payment processing to kitchen operations to workforce management, PMs must balance the demands of a massive installed base with the company's ambitious forward-looking strategy. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership is a defining moment for Toast PMs — the integration requires product leaders who can design experiences that work seamlessly across dine-in, takeout, and delivery, creating a unified restaurant commerce platform that neither company offers alone.

Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence product — is the most strategically important product initiative on the roadmap. PMs leading Toast IQ workstreams are defining how artificial intelligence surfaces actionable insights to restaurant operators: predicting staffing needs, optimizing menu pricing, identifying food waste patterns, and forecasting demand. This is not incremental feature work — it is the creation of an entirely new product category. Toast's $4B+ revenue provides the financial foundation, but the Hospitality Intelligence premium is what drives the $20B+ market cap and makes Toast equity particularly attractive for product leaders who want to shape the future of an entire industry.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Product Vision:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership creates a once-in-a-generation product opportunity — designing the integrated restaurant commerce experience across 120,000+ Toast locations and Instacart's delivery network. I bring direct experience shipping cross-platform product integrations at scale, and the PM leading this workstream will define how restaurants manage their entire business from a single platform. This strategic product ownership warrants compensation at the top of the PM band — $200,000 base in Boston."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Product Definition:** "Toast IQ is the product that transforms Toast from a restaurant tools company into a Hospitality Intelligence platform. The PM driving Toast IQ's roadmap is literally defining a new product category — AI-powered restaurant intelligence that no competitor offers at this scale. I have direct experience in AI/ML product management and I understand how to translate complex data capabilities into simple, operator-friendly experiences. I'm requesting $180,000 in RSUs over four years to match the strategic weight of this product initiative."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Platform Strategy:** "Toast's platform serves 120,000+ locations and processes billions in payments, but the PM role is about much more than maintaining what exists — it's about evolving the restaurant OS to capture new revenue streams. My experience in platform product management at [previous company] means I understand how to grow ARPU through product expansion while keeping the core experience reliable. This platform strategy expertise justifies a signing bonus of $20,000-$30,000."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Category Creation:** "Toast is creating the Hospitality Intelligence category, and the PMs who define it will shape the company's trajectory for the next decade. This is category-creation work, not incremental optimization, and it requires product leaders with both strategic vision and execution discipline. I'm evaluating offers from [competitors] where total comp ranges from $280,000-$340,000. I'd like Toast's offer to reflect the unique upside of building a new category at a company with Toast's distribution advantage."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 75th percentile and emphasize category-creation scope. Push base salary by $15,000-$20,000 and RSU grants by 25-30% above initial offer. For Boston, target $195,000 base + $170,000 RSU/4yr + $40,000 bonus = $288,000 total comp. For New York, target $210,000 base + $190,000 RSU/4yr + $44,000 bonus = $312,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base with $130,000 RSUs in Boston; $190,000 base with $150,000 RSUs in New York; $200,000 base with $165,000 RSUs in San Francisco. Lead with the Toast IQ narrative — PMs who can credibly claim they will own the Hospitality Intelligence product roadmap have maximum leverage. If equity is capped, push for a $25,000 signing bonus and accelerated first-year vest.
