**Negotiation DNA**

Engineering Managers at Toast sit at the intersection of technical execution and organizational strategy, leading teams that build and operate the restaurant operating system serving 120,000+ locations. This is not a project management role — Toast EMs are expected to maintain deep technical fluency while scaling engineering teams through one of the company's most transformative periods. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has created new cross-functional engineering workstreams that require managers who can coordinate distributed teams, manage complex integration timelines, and ship at the pace that a multi-billion-dollar partnership demands.

The launch of Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence platform — has reshaped the engineering organization. New teams are forming around machine learning infrastructure, real-time analytics, and intelligence product engineering. Engineering Managers leading these teams are directly responsible for the product that Wall Street is pricing into Toast's growth trajectory. With $4B+ in revenue and a $20B+ market cap, Toast compensates EMs competitively with public fintech and enterprise SaaS companies, but the Hospitality Intelligence thesis means equity grants carry significant growth potential. Candidates with experience managing platform engineering teams, payments infrastructure groups, or ML/AI engineering organizations have the strongest negotiation position.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Team Leadership:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership requires engineering managers who can lead cross-company integration teams — coordinating Toast and Instacart engineers to deliver a seamless restaurant-to-delivery experience across 120,000+ locations. I've managed comparable cross-organizational technical partnerships at [previous company], delivering on tight timelines while maintaining engineering quality. This partnership leadership capability warrants a base salary at the top of the EM band — $240,000 in Boston."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Team Building:** "Toast IQ is the centerpiece of the Hospitality Intelligence strategy, and the engineering teams building it need managers who understand both AI infrastructure and product delivery. I've built and scaled ML engineering teams from the ground up, and I can accelerate Toast IQ's roadmap by hiring and retaining the specialized talent this initiative requires. I'm asking for $250,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect the direct impact of my team-building work on Toast's strategic direction."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Engineering Scale:** "Managing engineering teams at Toast's scale — 120,000+ restaurant locations, billions in processed payments, real-time uptime requirements — demands operational maturity that few managers possess. My experience managing teams responsible for comparable-scale production systems means I can maintain velocity without sacrificing reliability. This operational experience justifies a 20% premium on the initial equity offer."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Talent Market:** "Engineering managers who combine technical depth with people leadership in the fintech-meets-vertical-SaaS space are extremely scarce. Toast's Hospitality Intelligence ambition requires EMs who can recruit, retain, and develop engineers at the intersection of payments, restaurant tech, and AI. I'm currently considering opportunities at [competitors] with total comp packages in the $350,000-$420,000 range. I'd like Toast's offer to reflect the market rate for this specialized leadership profile."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 75th percentile and lead with equity. Push RSU grants by 25-30% above initial offer, framing equity upside around Toast IQ's revenue potential. For Boston, target $235,000 base + $240,000 RSU/4yr + $48,000 bonus = $343,000 total comp. For New York, target $250,000 base + $270,000 RSU/4yr + $52,000 bonus = $380,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $210,000 base with $180,000 RSUs in Boston; $225,000 base with $210,000 RSUs in New York; $240,000 base with $240,000 RSUs in San Francisco. If equity is firm, negotiate a $30,000-$45,000 signing bonus citing the Instacart partnership urgency and team-building ramp time. Always negotiate management scope — a larger initial team (8+ reports) justifies higher compensation at review time.
