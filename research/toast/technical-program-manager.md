**Negotiation DNA**

Technical Program Managers at Toast orchestrate the most complex cross-functional initiatives at the company — coordinating engineering, product, design, operations, and external partners to deliver programs that span the entire restaurant operating system. With 120,000+ restaurant locations on the platform and a product surface area that includes payments, kitchen operations, workforce management, and now AI-powered intelligence, TPMs at Toast manage programs with more moving parts than at most technology companies. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership is the definitive TPM challenge: coordinating engineering teams across two publicly traded companies, managing integration milestones, and ensuring that the combined product experience launches seamlessly across the restaurant network.

Toast IQ — the company's Hospitality Intelligence platform — is a multi-quarter, cross-team program that requires TPMs who can manage the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, product development, and go-to-market execution. This is not a single-team project with a clear finish line — it is an ongoing platform program that will evolve as Toast's AI capabilities mature. TPMs driving Toast IQ are directly responsible for the velocity at which Toast's most strategic initiative reaches market. Toast's $4B+ revenue and $20B+ market cap create a compensation environment where TPMs are valued as force multipliers, and candidates with experience managing large-scale platform programs or cross-company partnerships have the strongest negotiation position.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Program Leadership:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership is Toast's most complex cross-company program — requiring coordination across engineering, product, legal, operations, and two separate company cultures. I've led comparable multi-company integration programs at [previous company], delivering on aggressive timelines while managing stakeholder complexity across organizations. The scope and strategic importance of this program justifies a base salary of $195,000 in Boston, at the top of the TPM band."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Program Orchestration:** "Toast IQ is a multi-quarter platform program spanning data engineering, ML, product, and go-to-market teams. The TPM driving this initiative directly controls the velocity at which Toast's Hospitality Intelligence strategy reaches 120,000+ restaurant locations. I bring experience managing AI/ML platform programs from research through production deployment, and I'm requesting $135,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect the strategic leverage of this program leadership role."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Platform Coordination:** "Toast's restaurant operating system touches payments, kitchen operations, workforce management, guest engagement, and now intelligence — and TPMs coordinate releases and dependencies across all of these domains for 120,000+ locations. My experience managing platform-wide release programs at [previous company] means I can navigate this complexity from day one. I'd like a $15,000-$20,000 signing bonus to reflect this immediate program-leadership capability."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Delivery Urgency:** "Toast is in a race to establish the Hospitality Intelligence category before competitors can respond, and TPMs control the delivery pace. The combination of the Instacart partnership timeline, Toast IQ's roadmap, and the ongoing restaurant OS evolution creates a program management challenge that requires deep technical fluency and exceptional organizational skills. I'm evaluating TPM offers from [competitors] in the $260,000-$320,000 total comp range. I'd like Toast's equity to reflect the urgency and strategic importance of this delivery timeline."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 75th percentile and frame compensation around strategic program impact. Push base salary by $12,000-$15,000 and RSU grants by 25% above initial offer. For Boston, target $190,000 base + $125,000 RSU/4yr + $30,000 bonus = $262,000 total comp. For New York, target $205,000 base + $145,000 RSU/4yr + $35,000 bonus = $291,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base with $105,000 RSUs in Boston; $180,000 base with $120,000 RSUs in New York; $195,000 base with $135,000 RSUs in San Francisco. TPMs should cite specific large-scale program outcomes — on-time delivery of $X million programs, coordination across Y teams — to justify top-of-band compensation. If equity is capped, push for a $20,000-$25,000 signing bonus tied to the Instacart partnership ramp timeline.
