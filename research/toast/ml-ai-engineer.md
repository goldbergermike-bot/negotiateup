**Negotiation DNA**

ML/AI Engineers at Toast are the architects of Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence platform and its most strategically important product initiative. This is not an ML research lab; it is applied machine learning at massive scale, building production models that serve real-time predictions and intelligence to 120,000+ restaurant locations. The models ML/AI engineers build — demand forecasting, dynamic menu pricing, staffing optimization, fraud detection, customer behavior prediction — directly translate into subscription revenue as restaurant operators pay premium fees for AI-driven insights that improve their margins.

The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has created new ML opportunities that dramatically expand the scope of this role. By combining Toast's in-restaurant transaction data with Instacart's delivery ordering patterns, ML/AI engineers can build models that predict total restaurant demand across all channels — a capability that no competitor can replicate. This data fusion enables new model architectures for cross-channel demand forecasting, delivery time optimization, and unified customer intelligence. Toast's $4B+ revenue and $20B+ market cap are increasingly dependent on the Hospitality Intelligence thesis, making ML/AI engineers among the most highly compensated and strategically critical hires at the company. The talent market for production ML engineers is intensely competitive, with Toast competing against FAANG, fintech unicorns, and AI-native companies for the same candidates.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership ML Fusion:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership creates a unique ML opportunity — combining Toast's in-restaurant transaction data with Instacart's delivery data to build cross-channel demand forecasting models that no competitor can replicate. I've built comparable multi-source ML systems at [previous company], and the model architectures required for this data fusion across 120,000+ restaurant locations represent some of the most technically challenging work in applied ML. This unique opportunity justifies a base salary of $225,000 in Boston, with proportional increases in New York and San Francisco."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Core Model Development:** "Toast IQ's Hospitality Intelligence platform depends on production ML models — demand forecasting, menu optimization, staffing prediction, anomaly detection, and customer intelligence. These are not experimental prototypes; they are revenue-generating products that restaurant operators pay premium fees to access. I bring direct experience shipping production ML models at scale, and I'm requesting $200,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect the direct revenue connection between my work and Toast's growth trajectory."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Intelligence Layer:** "Building the ML intelligence layer for a platform serving 120,000+ restaurant locations requires engineers who can handle the full ML lifecycle — from feature engineering on massive transaction datasets to model training, serving, monitoring, and retraining at scale. My experience with end-to-end ML systems, including real-time inference with sub-100ms latency requirements, maps directly to Toast IQ's production requirements. I'm requesting a $25,000-$35,000 signing bonus to reflect the scarcity of this production ML expertise."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence AI Premium:** "The talent market for ML/AI engineers is the most competitive in the technology industry, and Toast is competing against Google, Meta, OpenAI, and every AI-native startup for the same candidates. The Hospitality Intelligence positioning gives Toast a unique pitch — applied ML with immediate real-world impact at massive scale — but the compensation must be competitive with these alternatives. I'm evaluating offers in the $350,000-$420,000 total comp range. I'd like Toast's offer, particularly the equity component, to reflect the strategic importance of ML to Toast's growth thesis and the intensity of the talent market."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 80th percentile — ML/AI is Toast's most competitive hiring market. Push base salary by $15,000-$25,000 and RSU grants by 30-35% above initial offer. For Boston, target $220,000 base + $190,000 RSU/4yr + $38,000 bonus = $306,000 total comp. For New York, target $235,000 base + $220,000 RSU/4yr + $42,000 bonus = $342,000 total comp. For San Francisco, target $255,000 base + $250,000 RSU/4yr + $48,000 bonus = $385,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $195,000 base with $160,000 RSUs in Boston; $210,000 base with $180,000 RSUs in New York; $225,000 base with $200,000 RSUs in San Francisco. ML/AI engineers should always present competing offers — the talent market makes this expected and maximizes leverage. If equity is capped, push for a $30,000-$40,000 signing bonus and request an accelerated first-year RSU vest of 33%.
