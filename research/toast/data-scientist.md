**Negotiation DNA**

Data Scientists at Toast occupy a uniquely privileged position: access to one of the richest transaction datasets in the restaurant industry. With 120,000+ restaurant locations processing billions of dollars in payments, Toast generates granular data on consumer behavior, menu performance, staffing patterns, seasonal trends, and operational efficiency across every restaurant category — from fast casual to fine dining. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has further enriched this dataset by connecting in-restaurant transaction data with delivery ordering patterns, creating a 360-degree view of restaurant commerce that no competitor can replicate.

Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence platform — is where data science work translates directly into product revenue. Data scientists building models for Toast IQ are creating the demand forecasting algorithms, menu optimization engines, staffing predictors, and anomaly detection systems that restaurant operators will pay premium subscription fees to access. This is not internal analytics work — it is product-facing data science that directly impacts Toast's revenue trajectory. With $4B+ in revenue and the Hospitality Intelligence strategy driving the company's $20B+ market cap, data scientists at Toast have exceptional negotiation leverage, particularly those with experience in time-series forecasting, recommendation systems, or applied ML in commerce environments.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Data Enrichment:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership creates the most comprehensive restaurant commerce dataset in the industry — combining Toast's in-restaurant transaction data with Instacart's delivery patterns across 120,000+ locations. As a data scientist, I would be working with this combined dataset to build models that neither company could create alone. This unique data advantage justifies a base salary at the top of the band — $195,000 in Boston — because the modeling opportunities here are unmatched in the industry."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Model Development:** "Toast IQ's Hospitality Intelligence platform depends on data scientists building production-grade models — demand forecasting, menu optimization, staffing prediction, and anomaly detection. These are not experimental research projects; they are revenue-generating products that restaurants will pay for. I bring direct experience shipping ML models into production at [previous company], and I'd like my RSU grant to reflect the revenue impact of this work — $140,000 over four years in Boston."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Analytics at Scale:** "Toast's dataset spans 120,000+ restaurant locations, billions in transactions, and every restaurant category in the country. Building models at this scale — with real-time latency requirements and the operational complexity of the restaurant industry — requires specialized expertise. My experience with large-scale time-series forecasting and real-time model serving maps directly to Toast's needs. I'm requesting a $20,000 signing bonus to reflect the immediate impact I can deliver."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Talent Scarcity:** "Data scientists who understand both restaurant operations and production ML are exceptionally rare. Toast's Hospitality Intelligence positioning requires someone who can translate raw transaction data into the actionable insights that make Toast IQ valuable to restaurant operators. I'm evaluating offers from [competitors] where total comp for this specialization ranges from $280,000-$330,000. I'd like Toast's equity component to close that gap, especially given the upside potential as Toast IQ scales."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 75th percentile and lead with the Toast IQ revenue argument. Push base salary by $12,000-$18,000 and RSU grants by 25-30% above initial offer. For Boston, target $190,000 base + $135,000 RSU/4yr + $30,000 bonus = $264,000 total comp. For New York, target $205,000 base + $155,000 RSU/4yr + $35,000 bonus = $294,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $170,000 base with $110,000 RSUs in Boston; $180,000 base with $125,000 RSUs in New York; $195,000 base with $140,000 RSUs in San Francisco. Data scientists should emphasize production ML experience and time-series expertise — these skills map directly to Toast IQ's core models and create maximum negotiation leverage on equity.
