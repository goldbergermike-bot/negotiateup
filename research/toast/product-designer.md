**Negotiation DNA**

Product Designers at Toast face a uniquely challenging design problem: creating intuitive, high-performance interfaces that work in the chaos of a restaurant environment — grease-covered screens, rushed servers, dim lighting, and zero tolerance for latency. With 120,000+ restaurant locations using Toast's hardware and software every day, design decisions directly impact the speed, accuracy, and satisfaction of every transaction. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership introduces a new design surface — the integration between Toast's restaurant OS and Instacart's delivery platform must feel seamless to restaurant operators managing dine-in, takeout, and delivery simultaneously from a single screen.

Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence product — represents the most exciting design opportunity at the company. Designers working on Toast IQ are inventing how AI-generated insights are presented to restaurant owners who may have no technical background: visualizing demand forecasts, staffing recommendations, menu optimization suggestions, and real-time business health metrics. This is information design at its most impactful — turning complex machine learning outputs into actionable decisions for operators running restaurants on thin margins. Toast's $4B+ revenue and Hospitality Intelligence strategy mean designers here are not decorating features; they are shaping the product experience that drives the company's $20B+ valuation.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Integration Experience Design:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership requires designers who can create a unified order management experience across dine-in, takeout, and delivery channels — all on a single Toast terminal in a high-pressure restaurant environment. I've designed for similarly constrained, high-throughput environments at [previous company], and bringing this experience to 120,000+ restaurant locations warrants compensation at the upper end of the design band — $180,000 base in Boston."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Intelligence Visualization:** "Toast IQ is fundamentally a design problem — how do you present AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence insights to restaurant operators who need to make fast decisions? I specialize in data visualization and information architecture, which are the exact skills needed to make Toast IQ's analytics accessible and actionable. I'm requesting $110,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect my direct impact on the product that defines Toast's growth strategy."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Design System:** "Toast's design system serves 120,000+ restaurant locations across diverse hardware configurations, screen sizes, and environmental conditions. A designer who can evolve this system while maintaining consistency and performance is essential to Toast's platform strategy. My experience building and scaling design systems at [previous company] means I can contribute to this critical infrastructure immediately. I'd like a $15,000-$20,000 signing bonus to reflect this immediate-impact capability."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence UX Authority:** "Designing for the Hospitality Intelligence category requires a rare combination of data design expertise, empathy for non-technical users, and understanding of restaurant operations. Toast is creating a new category where the design quality directly determines adoption. I'm evaluating offers from [competitors] where total comp ranges from $220,000-$270,000 for senior designers. I'd like Toast's offer to be competitive, particularly on equity, given the growth trajectory of the Hospitality Intelligence platform."
