**Negotiation DNA**

Data Engineers at Toast build and maintain the data infrastructure that powers the restaurant industry's most comprehensive analytics and intelligence platform. With 120,000+ restaurant locations generating transaction data, operational metrics, workforce patterns, and customer behavior signals, Toast's data platform ingests, transforms, and serves one of the richest datasets in the hospitality industry. Every data pipeline a data engineer builds directly feeds Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence platform — making this role foundational to Toast's most strategic product initiative.

The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has multiplied the data engineering challenge. Integrating Instacart's delivery order data with Toast's in-restaurant transaction data creates a unified commerce dataset that requires new ingestion pipelines, data quality frameworks, and real-time streaming architectures. Data engineers must handle the schema reconciliation, data governance, and pipeline reliability challenges that come with merging data from two large-scale production platforms. Toast's $4B+ revenue and $20B+ market cap are increasingly driven by the company's data assets and intelligence capabilities — meaning data engineers are building the infrastructure that underpins Toast's valuation thesis. Candidates with experience in real-time streaming (Kafka, Flink), large-scale data warehousing (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and ML feature engineering carry the strongest negotiation leverage.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Data Integration:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership requires data engineers who can build the integration pipelines between Toast's restaurant transaction data and Instacart's delivery order data — creating a unified commerce dataset across 120,000+ restaurant locations. I've built comparable cross-platform data integration pipelines at [previous company], handling schema reconciliation, data quality, and real-time streaming at scale. This integration expertise justifies a base salary at the top of the band — $195,000 in Boston."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Data Platform Foundation:** "Toast IQ's entire Hospitality Intelligence platform is built on top of the data infrastructure that data engineers create and maintain. Every AI model, every analytics dashboard, every intelligence insight depends on data pipelines being fast, reliable, and accurate. I bring expertise in real-time streaming architectures and ML feature engineering — the exact skills that power Toast IQ's core capabilities. I'm requesting $130,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect my foundational contribution to Toast's strategic intelligence platform."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Data Scale:** "Toast's data platform processes billions of transactions from 120,000+ restaurant locations, with real-time latency requirements for payment processing and near-real-time requirements for analytics. Building data infrastructure at this scale — with the reliability demands of a payment platform and the flexibility demands of an intelligence product — requires specialized expertise. My track record operating data platforms at comparable scale justifies a $18,000-$22,000 signing bonus."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Data Moat:** "Toast's data is its most defensible competitive asset — no other company has transaction-level data from 120,000+ restaurant locations combined with Instacart delivery data. Data engineers who build the infrastructure that makes this data accessible and actionable are creating the moat that protects Toast's Hospitality Intelligence positioning. I'm evaluating data engineering roles at [competitors] with total comp in the $260,000-$320,000 range. I'd like Toast's equity component to reflect the strategic value of the data platform I would be building."
