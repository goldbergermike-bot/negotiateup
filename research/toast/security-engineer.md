**Negotiation DNA**

Security Engineers at Toast protect one of the most sensitive technology platforms in the restaurant industry. With 120,000+ restaurant locations processing billions of dollars in payments, Toast's security posture is a regulatory requirement, a merchant trust imperative, and an existential business concern. Every transaction must comply with PCI-DSS standards, every restaurant operator's data must be protected under evolving privacy regulations, and the entire platform must defend against fraud, data breaches, and operational security threats. The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership has expanded the security surface dramatically — the integration between Toast's restaurant OS and Instacart's delivery platform creates new data flows, API attack surfaces, and cross-platform authentication challenges that security engineers must address before the partnership can scale.

Toast IQ — the company's AI-powered Hospitality Intelligence platform — introduces new security dimensions. The platform aggregates sensitive restaurant financial data, employee information, and customer behavior patterns to generate AI-driven insights. Security engineers must ensure this data pipeline complies with privacy regulations, that ML models cannot be exploited to leak merchant data, and that the Hospitality Intelligence platform meets the security standards that enterprise restaurant groups demand. Toast's $4B+ revenue and $20B+ market cap depend on the trust that merchants place in the platform's security — making security engineers among the most strategically important hires at the company.

### Toast IQ — The Hospitality Intelligence Premium

**Lever 1 — Instacart Partnership Security Architecture:** "The Feb 10 2026 Instacart Partnership creates new cross-platform data flows between Toast and Instacart — payment data, order information, and merchant credentials traversing between two publicly traded companies. Securing this integration across 120,000+ restaurant locations requires expertise in API security, cross-platform authentication, and PCI-DSS compliance for multi-party data sharing. I've designed security architectures for comparable cross-company integrations, and this critical capability warrants a base salary of $205,000 in Boston."

**Lever 2 — Toast IQ Data Security:** "Toast IQ's Hospitality Intelligence platform aggregates sensitive financial, operational, and behavioral data to generate AI-driven insights. Ensuring this data pipeline is secure — from ingestion to model training to insight delivery — requires security engineers who understand ML pipeline security, data privacy regulations, and the unique threats facing AI systems. I bring direct experience in ML security and data protection, and I'm requesting $140,000 in RSUs over four years to reflect the strategic importance of securing Toast's most valuable data asset."

**Lever 3 — Restaurant OS Payments Security:** "Toast processes billions of dollars in payments across 120,000+ restaurant locations, and every transaction must meet PCI-DSS Level 1 standards. A security breach would not only expose Toast to regulatory penalties but would destroy the merchant trust that underlies the entire business. My PCI-DSS certification and experience securing payment platforms at [previous company] means I can protect this critical infrastructure immediately. I'm requesting a $20,000 signing bonus to reflect this compliance-critical expertise."

**Lever 4 — Hospitality Intelligence Compliance Premium:** "As Toast expands its Hospitality Intelligence platform, the regulatory and compliance landscape grows more complex — privacy regulations, AI governance requirements, and enterprise security audits from major restaurant groups. Security engineers who can navigate this intersection of technology, regulation, and business are exceptionally scarce. I'm evaluating security roles at [competitors] with total comp in the $270,000-$330,000 range. I'd like Toast's offer to reflect the premium that the market places on this specialized expertise."

> **Negotiate Up Strategy:** Anchor to the 75th percentile and lead with regulatory/compliance leverage. Push base salary by $12,000-$18,000 and RSU grants by 25% above initial offer. For Boston, target $200,000 base + $135,000 RSU/4yr + $28,000 bonus = $262,000 total comp. For New York, target $215,000 base + $150,000 RSU/4yr + $32,000 bonus = $290,000 total comp. Accept-at floor: $175,000 base with $105,000 RSUs in Boston; $188,000 base with $120,000 RSUs in New York; $200,000 base with $135,000 RSUs in San Francisco. Security engineers should cite PCI-DSS certification and compliance expertise — Toast cannot operate without PCI compliance, making this a non-fungible skill that commands premium compensation.
